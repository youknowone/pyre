//! Out-of-line guard-failure stubs and `patch_jump_for_descr`.
//!
//! `x86/assembler.py generate_quick_failure` / `write_pending_failure_recoveries`
//! emit a per-guard stub after the loop body; `patch_pending_failure_recoveries`
//! stores the stub address on `faildescr.adr_jump_offset`. `patch_jump_for_descr`
//! (x86) / `patch_trace` (aarch64) later overwrite that stub with a jump to the
//! attached bridge. Dynasm ports the same pair as `generate_quick_failure` and
//! `write_redirect_branch`.
//!
//! Cranelift cannot lay the stub down inside the loop function (Ion would
//! allocate across it), so each guard gets a 20-byte trampoline in the
//! assembler arena. The loop's failure block `return_call`s that trampoline
//! (`CallConv::Tail`); the trampoline is a `JMP`/`B` to either the shared
//! `_build_failure_recovery` helper or, once a bridge is attached, the
//! bridge body. The hop is `JMP`/`B`, not `BL`: `return_call` already tore
//! the loop frame down, and a linked branch would leak a return address
//! (`emit_attached_bridge_dispatch` previously did that under closing_jump).
