//! Decline census: make a silently-refused lowering countable.
//!
//! Every lowering gate in this pipeline refuses with a bare `continue`,
//! `return 0`, or `false`.  None of them raises, none of them warns, and
//! none of them counts — so when a probe does not move after a change,
//! nothing in the tree can say whether the gate the change targeted was
//! consulted and said no, or was never reached at all.  Reading a jitcode
//! list by hand is currently the only way to tell those apart.
//!
//! Upstream is loud exactly where this pipeline is silent:
//! `rpython/jit/codewriter/jtransform.py`'s `_handle_list_call` raises
//! `NotImplementedError("prebuilt lists cannot be virtual")` rather than
//! falling through to a residual, so an unhandled shape stops translation
//! with its own name attached.  This module does NOT turn any decline into
//! an error — every gate keeps its exact current control flow — it only
//! records that the decline happened and why, so the same information
//! upstream would have raised is at least countable here.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! - **Nothing reads these counters to decide anything.**  The only
//!   consumers are [`snapshot`] and [`dump_to_stderr`], both of which
//!   write to stderr / return data to a test.  No gate branches on a
//!   count, so an instrumented build takes exactly the lowering decisions
//!   an uninstrumented one takes.
//! - **Off by default.**  With neither switch set, every recorder returns
//!   before touching the map or formatting anything; [`record`] takes its
//!   `subject` as `fmt::Arguments`, so the caller's `format_args!`
//!   allocates nothing on the disabled path.
//! - **A count names its gate AND its reason.**  A bare "something
//!   declined" count would reproduce the problem this module exists to
//!   fix, one level up.  Where a gate classifies its own refusal — the
//!   dual gate's `cutover::unported_category` — the count key is the ARM
//!   that matched, since which arm dominates is what decides the next
//!   stretch of work.
//! - **Events and subjects are counted separately.**  [`record_named`]
//!   and [`record_reason`] also record the distinct subject, so a row
//!   reports "N events over M distinct graphs". Reading an event count as
//!   a graph count is wrong wherever a gate can revisit one graph.
//!
//! # Switches
//!
//! `MAJIT_DECLINE_LOG` is the switch; `MAJIT_MIR_FRONTEND_DEBUG` (the
//! existing front-end debug switch, `front/checked_arith.rs` et al.) is
//! accepted as an alias at level 1 so a reader who already knows this
//! codebase's debug channel does not have to learn a second one.
//!
//! | value | effect |
//! |---|---|
//! | unset | disabled — no counting, no output, no formatting |
//! | `1` (or `MAJIT_MIR_FRONTEND_DEBUG` set) | count per (gate, reason); [`record_reason`] also prints its runtime reason |
//! | `2` | the above, plus one stderr line per individual decline |
//!
//! Level 1 does not print per-event lines because the instrumented gates
//! include per-op ones (`guess_call_kind` runs once per call operation in
//! every graph); a whole-program run would emit tens of thousands of
//! lines and bury the summary.  [`record_reason`] is the exception: its
//! callers are per-graph, and its reason is a runtime string that the
//! bounded count key cannot carry.
//!
//! # Reading a decline count
//!
//! A gate that reports zero declines is *not* the same as a gate that
//! accepted everything: it can equally mean the gate was never reached.
//! Where that distinction matters the gate also records the reached-but-
//! declined case under a distinct reason, so a missing row and a zero row
//! stay different observations.
//!
//! Population filters are deliberately NOT recorded.  `fuse_boxing_alloc`
//! inspects every operation in a graph and skips the ones that are not
//! `malloc_typed` calls at all; counting those would make the instrument
//! part of the population it measures — the count would be dominated by
//! operations that were never candidates.  Recording starts once a site
//! has been identified as the kind of thing the gate exists to lower.
