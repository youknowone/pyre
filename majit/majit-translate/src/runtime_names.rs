//! The names this crate matches by spelling, in one place.
//!
//! `majit-translate` is a line-by-line port of `rpython/{flowspace,annotator,
//! rtyper,translator}` plus a Rust front end, and pyre is the only consumer
//! that drives it. Two families of name follow from that: the intrinsic shims
//! pyre exports for the flowspace HOST_ENV, and the crate, module and symbol
//! spellings its extracted LLBC carries.
//!
//! `scripts/check-majit-boundary.py` keeps runtime-owned *identifiers* out of
//! this subtree, but it reads Rust tokens and deliberately skips string
//! literals — so the names below are exactly the ones it cannot see. That is
//! the failure this module is for: a shim's name is a contract with whoever
//! exports it, and a contract written out at every site is one that can be
//! half-changed. `__cast_instance_intrinsic` is registered in the HOST_ENV,
//! given an annotator, matched by the rtyper and asserted in a dozen fixtures,
//! and a rename that misses one of those still builds — the lookup simply
//! misses and the operation falls back, which is the failure mode nothing
//! counts.
//!
//! So the names live here and the rest of the crate refers to them. That does
//! not decouple anything, and it is not meant to: [`crate::front`] says
//! outright that it is the pyre-specific layer. A second consumer would seed
//! these the way [`crate::local_crates`] already seeds crate roots from the
//! loaded LLBC set — there is no second consumer today, so that machinery is
//! not written, and the list below is what it would take.
//!
//! # What deliberately stays outside this module
//!
//! The crate still says "pyre" elsewhere, in three kinds. None of them stays
//! because the name is upstream: a case-insensitive `pyre` over an RPython
//! checkout matches nothing at all. Each kind stays for its own reason.
//!
//! **Path matchers under [`crate::front`].** Thirty literals matching a
//! `pyre_object::` / `pyre_interpreter::` MIR path directly. That module's doc
//! states that every file under it is Rust-specific lowering with no RPython
//! structural match, and its maintenance rule is to justify the deviation
//! rather than avoid it. Naming such a path is what the layer is for; a
//! `front/` that named none would not be doing its job.
//!
//! **Diagnostic text.** The error and panic messages that spell a shim or a
//! crate, plus two skip labels (`callee-pyre-class-ctor`,
//! `skip-pyre-class-allocate-ctor`). These are not the failure this module
//! exists to prevent. The lookup sites moved because a lookup that misses is
//! SILENT — the operation falls back and nothing counts it. A message is read
//! by whoever hits it, so a stale one announces itself; routing it through a
//! constant would buy consistency, not detection.
//!
//! **Environment gate names.** `PYRE_MIR_FRONTEND_DEBUG`, read by
//! [`crate::decline`]. This kind must not move, for a mechanical reason rather
//! than a stylistic one. `gate_triage_complete`'s `NAMESPACES` maps the
//! `PYRE_` prefix to `pyre/gate-triage.md` and checks both directions by
//! scanning source for the name as a quoted literal inside the `env::var` call
//! itself; its `gates_read_by` says outright that a gate held in a Rust const
//! does not count as live. Routing one through a constant here would not
//! rename anything — it would drop the gate out of the completeness check
//! while leaving it live — the same silent direction the shim names in this
//! module exist to escape.
//!
//! Rust item names are not on that list because this crate does not police
//! them: `scripts/check-majit-boundary.py` rejects a `pyre`-spelled identifier
//! or path component anywhere under `majit/`. That is a check rather than a
//! convention, and it reaches further than this module could — the jitcode keys
//! are spelled `*_ext/P` on both sides of the wire format because of it.

/// LLBC artefacts the fixtures load.
///
/// Built with `concat!` at the constant rather than at each site: `concat!`
/// takes literals, so a site that wants the path cannot compose it from a
/// `const &str` and would have to spell the tail again.
///
/// These are `build/` outputs, so a fixture naming one is `#[ignore]`d — it
/// asserts against an artefact that a plain `cargo test` has no reason to have
/// produced. Nothing outside a test names one, which is what the gate records:
/// a path into `build/` appearing in a non-test build would be this crate
/// reaching for an artefact at run time, and it does not.
