//! Rust-AST adapter's host-namespace resolver.
//!
//! Position-2 adaptation per
//! `~/.claude/plans/annotator-monomorphization-tier1-abstract-lake.md`:
//! pyre-interpreter is Rust source, not Python, so the upstream
//! `flowcontext.py:856 LOAD_GLOBAL` chain (co_names → func_globals →
//! module dict) has no direct analogue. The adapter routes name
//! resolution through this module.
//!
//! Two layers:
//!
//! 1. `PYRE_STDLIB` — closed-world registry of Rust-stdlib identifiers
//!    pyre source uses as control-flow constructors (`Ok`, `Some`,
//!    `Err`, `Result`, `Option`). Each maps to a process-singleton
//!    `HostObject::Class` so two graphs that mention `Ok` see the same
//!    identity (mirrors Python's `__builtin__.Ok` returning the same
//!    object across every `LOAD_GLOBAL`).
//! 2. `HOST_CLASS_MINTS` — process-global cache of `HostObject::Class`
//!    minted on demand for path-prefix names the closed-world registry
//!    does not cover (e.g. `StepResult` in `StepResult::Continue`).
//!    Same identity invariant as PYRE_STDLIB: two graphs that name
//!    `StepResult` share the same `HostObject` (`Arc::ptr_eq` per
//!    `model.rs:208`), mirroring upstream `func_globals[name]` at
//!    `flowcontext.py:847` returning the same Python object on every
//!    `LOAD_GLOBAL` regardless of which graph is being built.
//!
//! `None` is special-cased away from this layer because Python's
//! `None` is the NoneType *singleton instance*, not a class — it
//! resolves to `Constant(ConstValue::None)` directly at the lower_expr
//! site, matching upstream `Constant(None)` in flowspace graphs.
//!
//! ## `HOST_RUST_MODULE_GLOBALS` — module-globals layer
//!
//! Upstream `flowcontext.py:845-854 find_global` reads
//! `w_globals.value[varname]` where `self.w_globals =
//! Constant(func.__globals__)` is set at `flowcontext.py:284` —
//! the function's `func_globals` dict, i.e. its owning module's
//! `__dict__`. Two different modules with the same top-level name
//! (`MAX`, `helper`, `StepResult`, …) carry distinct values in their
//! respective `func.__globals__`; the lookup at `:847` reads the
//! *current function's* globals, not a shared one.
//!
//! The Rust-source counterpart populates this layer through
//! [`super::register::register_rust_module`] which walks a
//! `syn::File` (the analogue of "module import") and inserts each
//! top-level `Item::Enum` / `Item::Struct` / `Item::Const` here.
//! The registry's value type is [`ConstValue`] to mirror upstream's
//! any-Python-value semantics — classes wrap as
//! `ConstValue::HostObject(...)`, consts as `ConstValue::Int` /
//! `Bool` / `UniStr` / `ByteStr` directly.
//!
//! ## Per-module scoping (Issue 1.3 closed 2026-05-05)
//!
//! Each [`register_rust_module`](super::register::register_rust_module)
//! call mints a fresh [`ModuleId`] and partitions the registry
//! entries it writes under that id. A `Builder` carries the same
//! `ModuleId` so its lookups only see entries from the file the
//! walker walked — matching upstream `func.__globals__` per-function
//! scoping. Two `register_rust_module` walks of files that share a
//! top-level name no longer collide: each walk's entries live under
//! a distinct id, mirroring two Python modules whose `__dict__`s
//! happen to share a key.

// has no `&TranslationContext` handle when it lowers `Item::Fn`

// **Convergence (2026-05-11): production entry points now drain this
// thread-local into `TranslationContext._walker_pygraphs` at
// Translation construction time** (see
// [`drain_walker_pygraphs`] + the call site in

// drained, the production
// `translator::TranslationContext::buildflowgraph` reads from the

// longer consulted on the production path. Any prior-pass orphans
// that survive a Translation re-walk are also drained, leaving
// HOST_RUST_PYGRAPHS empty for the next walker run.
//
// Test fixtures that call `register_rust_module` directly (without
// constructing a `Translation`) still consult [`lookup_walker_pygraph`]
// because they have no context to drain into; the thread-local is
// the per-test process-wide carrier in that path. Cross-test bleed
// is acceptable (each test mints fresh `ModuleId`s + fresh
// `HostObject` identities).
//
// Full retirement of the thread-local requires Translator-binding
// through the walker entry surface (so the walker writes directly
// into `ctx._walker_pygraphs`); that is the multi-session work
// captured in plan
// `~/.claude/plans/annotator-monomorphization-tier1-abstract-lake.md`
// "Strict-parity Point 1: HOST_RUST_PYGRAPHS as Position-2 adapter".
//
// Closes Codex audit 1.1 (2026-05-08): walker callsites in
// [`super::register::register_rust_module`] used to drop the
// `Rc<PyGraph>` returned by
// [`super::register::build_host_function_from_rust_in_module`] and
// register only the `HostObject` in the module-globals partition.
// Downstream `FunctionDesc.buildgraph` then routed through
// `translator.buildflowgraph`; when the entry was not the file's
// named entry-point its `_prebuilt_graphs` lookup missed and the
// fallback `build_flow(graph_func)` ran against `HostCode.co_code
// = []` — producing an empty / wrong graph for every
// walker-registered sibling fn or impl method.
//
// Read order at `translator.rs:buildflowgraph` mirrors upstream's:
// explicit per-instance `_prebuilt_graphs.remove` seed first (the
// entry-point pair), then this walker registry as a second
// fallback before falling through to upstream `build_flow`.
//
// `Rc<PyGraph>` is `!Send` / `!Sync`, so the registry is
// `thread_local!` rather than `Mutex<HashMap<…>>`. Cross-thread
// translator instances each carry their own walker-output snapshot,
// matching upstream's per-Python-thread `_prebuilt_graphs`
// `RefCell<HashMap<…>>` (no cross-thread sharing).
//
// **Re-walk semantics (path-keyed [`ModuleId::for_path`])**: every
// walker pass-2 success `register_walker_pygraph`s the freshly
// minted `HostObject`. The prior walk's entries stay resident
// because their keys (the prior `HostObject`s) are no longer
// referenced from the module-globals partition (which the new walk
// last-writer-wins overwrote). They are inert orphans that
// `lookup_walker_pygraph` never consults — same shape as upstream
// `gc-collected def reload`. Acceptable for now; a follow-up may
// trim the registry by `module_id` partition during walker entry
// to release the orphans eagerly.
