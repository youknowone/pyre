//! `specialize_legacy_graph` cutover wrapper.
//!
//! Drives the real `RPythonTyper::specialize` against a pyre
//! `model::FunctionGraph` by way of the
//! [`crate::translator::rtyper::flowspace_adapter::function_graph_to_flowspace`]
//! adapter, then projects each per-`Variable` `LowLevelType` back to a
//! `ConcreteType` keyed by the original pyre `ValueId`.
//!
//! ## Why this file is in `translator/rtyper/`
//!
//! The legacy algorithms live alongside this file as
//! `translator/rtyper/legacy_{annotator,resolve,pipeline}.rs`.  This
//! cutover module is the long-lived bridge: the dual-gate (Slice 4),
//! the default flip (Slice 5), and the prod migration (Slice 6) all
//! call into the entry points defined here.  The `flowspace_adapter`
//! sibling continues bridging pyre's surface-DSL
//! `model::FunctionGraph` to the RPython `flowspace::FunctionGraph`
//! shape the rtyper consumes, until pyre's
//! `parse → front → SemanticProgram` chain learns to emit
//! `flowspace::FunctionGraph` directly.
//!
//! ## Slice 2 scope
//!
//! - Build a `FlowspaceAdapterOutput` via the Slice 1c adapter.
//! - Construct a fresh `RPythonAnnotator`; bypass `build_types`
//!   (pyre's surface DSL has no `HostObject` to feed it) by populating
//!   `annotator.annotated` and `annotator.all_blocks` directly with
//!   the adapter's blocks. The annotation shells from Slice 1a are
//!   already attached to each `Variable.annotation`, which is what
//!   `RPythonTyper.bindingrepr` reads.
//! - Construct an `RPythonTyper` and call `specialize(true)` —
//!   `dont_simplify_again=true` because pyre's legacy graph is already
//!   in simplified SSA shape; running the simplify pass would attempt
//!   to call into bookkeeper machinery that requires
//!   `RPythonAnnotator.translator.entry_point_graph`, which we have
//!   not seeded.
//! - Walk the `value_to_var` map and project each `Variable.concretetype`
//!   to `ConcreteType` (Signed/Float/GcRef/Void/Unknown).
//!
//! ## Slice 4 dual-gate readiness
//!
//! Today this function still fails on graphs containing Slice 1b
//! followups that are not yet ported (`Call`, `FieldRead`,
//! `ArrayRead`, ...). The Slice 4 anchor corpus will surface which
//! followup is the next priority. `Ref`-typed operands now route
//! through `valuetype_to_someshell(Ref) → SomeInstance(classdef=None)`
//! (`jit_codewriter/annotation_state.rs:69`), so the rtyper picks
//! `getinstancerepr(rtyper, None, Gc) → InstanceRepr::new_rootinstance
//! → Ptr(GcStruct(OBJECT))` and the projection collapses to
//! `ConcreteType::GcRef` matching the legacy resolver — the previous
//! `SomeObject` blocker is closed.
