//! `rpython/memory/gctransform/framework.py get_livevars_for_roots` —
//! which GC pointers are live across an operation that can collect.
//!
//! Upstream reads the answer straight off the flow graph with
//! `hop.livevars_after_op()`, then brackets the operation with
//! `push_roots` / `pop_roots`. The flowspace transformer now performs that
//! insertion automatically for translated graphs. Native interpreter paths
//! also run as rustc-compiled Rust, so this audit computes the corresponding
//! live set over ULLBC and reports where their source bracket is *missing*.
//!
//! # One deliberate divergence from upstream
//!
//! `get_livevars_for_roots` drops the current operation's own arguments for a
//! moving GC — *"moving GCs don't borrow, so the caller does not need to keep
//! the arguments alive"*.  That holds upstream because the shadowstack walks
//! the caller's frame and rewrites its copy in place.  pyre's shadow stack
//! holds only what was explicitly pinned, so an argument the caller still uses
//! after the call is just as stale as any other local.  Arguments are therefore
//! kept in the live set, and reported in a separate column so the two shapes
//! stay distinguishable.
