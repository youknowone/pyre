//! `PYRE_FNPTR_INDIRECT` — how a call through a host-registered `fn`
//! pointer lowers, in both states of the switch.
//!
//! Its own test binary, holding exactly one `#[test]`, because the switch is
//! read from the process environment at lowering time: a `set_var` inside
//! `test_mir_frontend.rs` would race the seventeen tests libtest runs
//! alongside it. One test in one process can toggle the cause and watch the
//! instrument respond, which is the whole point of the file.
