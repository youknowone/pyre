//! A lowered root bracket closes, in the crate that owns the guard and in a
//! crate that only imports it.
//!
//! The `Drop` of a `RootScope` is the bracket's `pop_roots`: it rewinds the
//! shadow stack to the length the matching `push_roots` captured. A lowering
//! that forwards past that terminator leaves the bracket open, and the slots
//! it pinned stay reachable for the life of the thread — every later
//! collection walks them, so a loop that opens one per iteration turns a
//! constant root set into a growing one.
//!
//! The close is spelled as a call taking the guard by reference rather than as
//! two field reads and a truncate, because a crate that imports `RootScope`
//! sees an opaque stub with no fields. Reading the fields would confine the
//! close to `pyre-object`, which is why `pyre_interpreter` is checked here and
//! not just `pyre_object`.
//!
//! Two things make the close conditional on more than the `Drop` arm existing,
//! and each has a fixture below. The guard has to reach the dropping block:
//! liveness counts a `Drop` place as a use only because the close reads it, and
//! without that the binding survives only when the dropping block happens to be
//! lowered right after the defining one. And the guard has to be one this body
//! still owns: a drop the artefact stamps `Conditional` runs under an
//! initialisation flag it does not carry, so a guard the body moves out of
//! keeps its bracket open rather than rewinding a stack its new owner holds.
//!
//! A third case owes no close at all. `erased_root_bracket_guards` names the
//! brackets the lowering takes out of the jitcode entirely: those open nothing
//! and pin nothing, so there is no shadow stack to rewind. Every assertion here
//! is stated over the brackets that survive that pass, which is why the
//! fixtures below are bodies whose brackets it keeps.
