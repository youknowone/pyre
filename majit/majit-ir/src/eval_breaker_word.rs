//! The single process-global eval-breaker word polled by JIT-compiled loop
//! back-edges. One `AtomicUsize` whose bits fold the two former back-edge
//! polls into one load + one nonzero branch:
//!   bit0 EB_ASYNC — an async ticker request; OR'd in by the OS signal handler
//!                   and action dispatcher, then copied into
//!                   `ActionFlag._ticker` at a safe interpreter checkpoint.
//!   bit1 EB_STW   — mirrors `GC_SYNC.stw_requested`; OR'd in by the collector
//!                   while it drains mutators to safepoints.
//!   bit2 EB_FINALIZING — mirrors interpreter finalization; once armed,
//!                        non-owner mutators park before their next opcode.
//!   bit3 EB_GC_INTERP — process-stable `PYRE_GC_INTERP` dispatch gate.  This
//!                       is masked out of compiled back-edge polls: it avoids
//!                       a second per-opcode atomic load in the interpreter,
//!                       but is not itself a reason to leave machine code.
//!   bit4 EB_GC    — the old-gen allocator reached the next-major threshold;
//!                   OR'd in by the collector, consumed by the interpreter
//!                   dispatch-loop GC safepoint.
//!   bit5 EB_MEMORY_ERROR — a bounded major collection exhausted the heap;
//!                   OR'd in by the collector where upstream raises, consumed
//!                   by the dispatch loop, which raises `MemoryError` there.
//!                   Published for every thread because it is a deopt trigger,
//!                   but delivered only to the thread whose collection
//!                   exhausted the heap; see `set_memory_error`.
//! A compiled loop loads the whole word at the back-edge and deopts to the
//! interpreter when it is non-zero. The interpreter/warm-up loop and the STW
//! park gate remain authoritative; this word is only the JIT's deopt trigger.
//!
//! Immortal process-global, zero from process start, so the guard is harmless
//! until a bit is armed. The trace records the address as the poll's constant
//! operand; the published-address holder (`EVAL_BREAKER_WORD_ADDR`) reads `0`
//! until published, and no poll is recorded in that case.
//!
//! The STW bit and authoritative request occupy two locations. A relaxed poll
//! can briefly deopt before the request is visible, then resume and re-deopt
//! until coherence propagates it; this is a bounded park-latency window.
