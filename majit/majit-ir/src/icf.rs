//! Distinguisher so LLVM MergeFunctions cannot fold two residual-call
//! targets that would otherwise have identical bodies.
//!
//! RPython's genc emits one C function per graph (`FunctionCodeGenerator`)
//! and never merges two graphs. `drain_list_append` keeps a forwarding call
//! for the same reason: one published address must name one function
//! (`registered_paths_sharing_an_address_are_alias_spellings`).
//!
//! `core::hint::black_box(ptr)` lowers to inline asm that may load through
//! the pointer and therefore clobbers all memory. `dont_look_inside` /
//! oopspec / call-surface bodies are not `#[inline(never)]`, so that
//! clobber was inlined into interpreter hot loops (dict ops, shadow-stack
//! push/pop).
//!
//! Native: empty `asm!` with `nomem, nostack, preserves_flags` whose template
//! comment carries a unique `const` immediate. LLVM MergeFunctions sees
//! distinct IR; inlined copies lower to zero instructions and do not clobber
//! memory. The token lives in this crate so Charon extracts a Call (the same
//! shape as `black_box`) rather than an `asm!` terminator the ULLBC reader
//! maps to `TermKind::Unknown`. wasm32 has no stable inline `asm!`; a
//! volatile read of the const local is a single-location load.
