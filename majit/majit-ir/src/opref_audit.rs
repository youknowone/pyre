//! Debug-gated detector for distinct `OpRef` variants sharing one `raw()` key.
//!
//! `OpRef::raw()` omits the enum tag, so values from different input, operation,
//! or constant namespaces can map to the same integer. A collision matters when
//! two numbering scopes feed one raw-keyed table; payload changes within the
//! same variant are valid rewrites and are not collisions.
//!
//! Constants are skipped because they have no raw key. Callers must therefore
//! instrument before any transformation that replaces a register with a
//! constant. This audit reports contested lookup keys; the bank check in
//! `translate_trace_iter_opref` separately validates the resolved value.
//!
//! Build with `jit-audits` to compile the instrumentation sites. In that
//! build, `MAJIT_OPREF_VARIANT_AUDIT=1` reports and `=abort` panics on the
//! first collision; with the environment gate off, `note` is one thread-local
//! read and a return. Without the Cargo feature, the module and its call sites
//! are absent.
//!
//! State and mode are thread-local because each trace is processed on one
//! thread and parallel tests must not share diagnostic observations.
//!
//! Retires when the two namespaces are made structurally uncollidable: at that
//! point a collision is unrepresentable rather than merely unobserved, and
//! this instrument has nothing left to detect.
