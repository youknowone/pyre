//! Direct port of the shared forwarding slot from
//! `rpython/jit/metainterp/resoperation.py AbstractResOpOrInputArg`,
//! carried on `Op` / `InputArg` themselves (`resoperation.py`).
//! The optimizer holds producer identities as [`crate::operand::Operand`];
//! this module hosts the [`Forwarded`] slot variant, the [`ForwardingHost`]
//! trait that exposes the `get_forwarded` / `set_forwarded_*` /
//! `ptr_info` / `int_bound` projections, and the borrow-guard wrappers those
//! projections hand back.
//!
//! Hosted in `majit-ir` so the slot can carry `Weak<Op>` / `Weak<InputArg>`
