//! JitCode — assembled bytecode + register/constant pools.
//!
//! RPython equivalent: `rpython/jit/codewriter/jitcode.py` class `JitCode`.
//!
//! In RPython this is a single shared type used by both the codewriter
//! (which writes into it via `Assembler.assemble`) and the metainterp
//! (which reads from it via `BlackholeInterpreter.dispatch_loop` and
//! `MetaInterp.handle_call_assembler`). majit currently has two `JitCode`
//! types — this `codewriter::jitcode::JitCode` (RPython orthodox encoding,
//! `insns` dict, dynamic argcodes) and `metainterp::jitcode::JitCode`
//! (pyre-specific BC_* hardcoded opcode set). Phase D will line-by-line
//! port `BlackholeInterpreter.setup_insns` so the metainterp can consume
//! this type directly, eliminating the fork.
