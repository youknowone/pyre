//! Marked-regex matching, from "An Efficient and Elegant Regular Expression
//! Matcher in Python" and "A JIT for Regular Expression Matching".
//!
//! A regex is a tree; each node holds one mutable `marked` bit, and one
//! `shift(c, mark)` per input character propagates the marks left to right.
//! Two things a reader should not have to guess: **the marks live in the
//! nodes**, not in the matcher, and `empty` — does this subexpression accept
//! the empty string? — is **computed once, at lowering time**, so the matcher
//! only reads it.
//!
//! `regex` builds and lowers the tree; `interp` is the plain matcher over the
//! lowered graph; `jit_interp` and `shortcircuit` are the two JIT portals.
//! `shortcircuit` is the faithful port of the post's own source, which writes
//! `shift` with `and`/`or`; `jit_interp` is the `&`/`|` variant part 2 of the
//! series recommends. `rpython_original/` runs the post's RPython through
//! RPython's own JIT and settles which is which — the traces agree op for op
//! on every structural count, and the guard counts (RPython 27, `shortcircuit`
//! 26, `jit_interp` 1) name the faithful one.
//!
//! This file is also the benchmark, and its measurement discipline is half of
//! what it has to say. Every number printed below without a disclaimer was
//! measured in this process, in this run: each row is the median of
//! [`REPEATS`] timed runs with its min-max range beside it, taken at three
//! input lengths, and every ratio is one measured row divided by another.
//! Nothing is a constant carried over from an earlier session. What this run
//! could not measure — the post's own 2010 figures — is printed under a heading
//! that says so, and no ratio above it is computed from any of it.
