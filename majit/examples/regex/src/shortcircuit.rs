//! The post's matcher as its own source writes it: a `shift` that branches.
//!
//! This is the module RPython's JIT produces the same trace for — see the
//! cross-check below. `jit_interp` next door is the *adapted* portal the
//! post's short-circuit remark tells you to write.
//!
//! "A JIT for Regular Expression Matching" says, without showing the numbers:
//!
//! > the JIT-version of the code needs to be adapted to use the
//! > non-short-circuiting operators `&` and `|` ... If you don't change the
//! > "and" and "or" you get a lot of assembler code generated, and it's not
//! > particularly fast
//!
//! `interp.rs` and `jit_interp.rs` both take that advice, and this crate had
//! documented it without ever measuring it. This module is the unadapted side
//! of the A/B, and therefore the post's own source: `jit_interp`'s portal
//! copied whole — same state fields, same greens, same three-instruction
//! program, same promote, same `_immutable_fields_` declarations, same inline
//! policy — with `shift`'s four arms written the way part 1's Python writes
//! them, `and`/`or` that stop early. The state struct's NAME is the one other
//! difference, and only so a degraded arm stays attributable; the field list is
//! identical. So the two portals differ in exactly the thing the remark is
//! about, which is what makes the comparison below an A/B rather than two
//! programs.
//!
//! # This is the module RPython's own JIT agrees with
//!
//! `rpython_original/` carries the post's matcher written in RPython — the
//! class hierarchy, `_immutable_fields_`, and a JitDriver whose green is the
//! regex — and `runner.py` puts it through `LLJitMixin`, the harness RPython's
//! own JIT tests use: the real metainterpreter, the real optimizer, the LLGraph
//! backend, in process. The loop that comes out is the trace RPython would
//! compile. Both sides scan the same 4096 bytes, pinned by an FNV-1a digest
//! asserted on both (`NONMATCHING_4096_FNV1A`).
//!
//! Peeled body, at both tree sizes:
//!
//! ```text
//!   93 nodes        RPython   this module   jit_interp
//!   getfield_gc_r         0             0            0

//!   total               153           176          194
//!
//!   21 nodes        RPython   this module   jit_interp

//! ```
//!
//! Every structural count is exact, at both sizes and on both portals: no
//! pointer read survives, one mark store per node, and two comparisons for the
//! `Char` nodes — the subset construction, performed by every tracer here. The
//! loop tails are the same ops in the same order (`int_add`, `setfield_gc`,
//! `int_lt`, `guard_true`, `jump`). At 21 nodes even the guard count agrees
//! exactly, 9 against 9.
//!
//! `the_peeled_body_matches_the_rpython_original` asserts that table and
//! prints it, so this is a gate rather than a paragraph. RPython's column is a
//! recorded constant — the Rust suite cannot call a Python 2 — with the
//! command to re-derive it beside the constant.
//!
//! ## The gate has been shown to fail
//!
//! A passing gate means nothing until it has been watched to fail. Three
//! breaks, each applied to this file and then reverted:
//!
//! | break | what the gate did |
//! |---|---|
//! | the portal's `promote(root)` removed, so the tree stops being constant | `getfield_gc_r` 0 → **84**, caught by the structural assertion |
//! | `Sequence` reads `left.marked` *after* the recursive shift instead of before | `getfield_gc_i` 24 → **1**, caught — and by six other tests, since it also changes the answer |
//! | the `Char` arm masks (`mark & (ch == c)`) instead of branching — **same answers, same specialization** | guards 26 → **28**, total 176 → **180** |
//!
//! The third is the one that shaped this gate. It was written first with the
//! branching guard count asserted as a band around RPython's 27, and the band
//! let 28 straight through: the whole suite passed with a `Char` arm silently
//! switched to the spelling the *other* portal is supposed to own. The band is
//! now an exact recorded value for majit's own two numbers, and the third
//! break fails.
//!
//! ## Speed
//!
//! `the_jit_is_worth_several_times_the_matcher_with_no_jit` measures the post's
//! headline ratio — the JIT against the same algorithm with no JIT under it —
//! in one process, over 1,048,576 characters, median of 5. On this machine,
//! `--release`, dynasm:
//!
//! ```text
//!   majit JIT : 36,530,817 chars/s   (min 28,390,215, max 37,312,110)
//!   no JIT    :  6,700,337 chars/s   (min  5,680,768, max  7,246,276)
//!   ratio     : 5.5x        the post's own: 16,500,000 / 720,000 = 22.9x
//! ```
//!
//! Ours is the smaller ratio because the denominator is better: `interp.rs`
//! through `rustc -O`, against RPython's C backend in 2010. Only the ratios
//! are comparable — never the absolute rows, sixteen years and two instruction
//! sets apart. A debug-profile run reads about 9.0x for the same reason in
//! reverse, and the test says so rather than letting the number be quoted.
//!
//! Cranelift read 2.6x in the same conditions, over a 6.3M-17.8M spread
//! against dynasm's 28.4M-37.3M. The backends agree op for op on every census
//! above and differ only here, which is what a compile-time difference looks
//! like: this row includes the one recording each `matches` call pays for, and
//! cranelift compiles slower. The floor is 1.5x so it clears both under
//! contention while staying far above the ~1x a lost finding would read.
//!
//! This is not a speed comparison against RPython. `rpython_original/` runs
//! under `meta_interp`, which executes traces in an interpreter; timing it
//! would measure the harness. The RPython comparison is the trace-shape one,
//! and it is exact.
//!
//! **And the guards say this module, not `jit_interp`, is the post's own
//! spelling.** The post's source is Python `and`/`or`, which really do
//! short-circuit, so RPython's tracer emits branches — 27 guards. This module
//! reproduces them with explicit `if`s and lands on 26. `jit_interp` masks with
//! `&`/`|` and has 1. So `jit_interp` is the *adapted* version the post's
//! remark tells you to write, and this module is what the post's code does
//! before you take that advice.
//!
//! # Where the 23 remaining ops come from
//!
//! 153 ops (RPython) against 176 (here). The difference is the port's integer
//! typing, and it accounts for every one of the 23.
//!
//! RPython carries the marks as `Bool`. A `Bool` local *is* a branch
//! condition, so `flatten.py` emits a plain `goto_if_not` and
//! `pyjitpl.py opimpl_goto_if_not` hands that box straight to
//! `generate_guard` — no truth test. A `Bool` field is likewise stored as it
//! stands, with no mask.
//!
//! Our `NodeRec.marked` is a `u8` and `shift` carries marks as `i64`, so both
//! conversions become real operations:
//!
//! * `if mark != 0` is an `IntIsTrue` — **24** of them, exactly one per guard
//!   whose condition is not already a comparison (26 guards, less the loop
//!   exit's `IntLt` and one `SetfieldGc`-fed guard); and
//! * `n.marked = m as u8` is an `IntAnd(m, 255)` — **2** survive, on the two
//!   live `Char` marks.
//!
//! 24 + 2, less RPython's one extra `guard_false` and its two zero-cost
//! `debug_merge_point`s, is 23.
//!
//! This is not a place majit falls short of RPython. `rewrite.py
//! optimize_INT_IS_TRUE` folds the test only when the argument's bounds are
//! `is_bool()`, and a one-byte unsigned field read is [0, 255] — upstream's
//! own `FieldDescr.get_integer_min` / `get_integer_max` answer the same for
//! `lltype.Bool`, since it is `FLAG_UNSIGNED` at size 1. The fold arm is
//! ported and fires elsewhere; it has nothing to fire on here. The two
//! `IntAnd` are the same story from the other end: `autogenintrules.py`'s
//! `and_x_c_in_range` would remove `int_and(x, 255)` for an `x` bounded by
//! [0, 1], but the `IntEq` producing that `x` is a postponed pure op forced
//! out *after* its consumer was optimized, so `make_bool` had not run on it
//! yet. Upstream never meets the pattern, because it never masks a `Bool`.
//!
//! `REGEX_LISTING=1` on the census test prints both peeled bodies op by op,
//! and `runner.py --listing` prints RPython's, for diffing.
//!
//! # The measurements
//!
//! Measured on this machine, dynasm, on the post's own
//! `(a|b)*a(a|b){20}a(a|b)*` — 93 nodes, balanced — over a non-matching random
//! `a`/`b` string. Two separate claims, because they have separate evidence.
//!
//! # 1. The post's claim, about code shape. It holds.
//!
//! The peeled loop body, which is what runs per input character:
//!
//! ```text
//!            ops guard_true guard_false gf_gc_r gf_gc_i setfield_gc int_eq guard_value
//! masking    194     1           0         0      24        93        2        0
//! branching  176     6          20         0      24        93        2        0
//! ```
//!
//! One guard against twenty-six. The masking body's single guard is the loop
//! exit — the `pos < len` test — and the branching body carries that one plus
//! twenty-five more, one per `and`/`or` whose operand the optimizer could not
//! prove constant. That is exactly the mechanism the post names: a branch the
//! tracer records becomes a guard, and masking has no branch to record.
//!
//! The surprise is the op count. The branching body is SMALLER, not bigger —
//! 176 against 194 — because a guard replaces the `int_and` / `int_or` it
//! stands in for, and because the dead side of a branch takes its ops out of
//! the trace with it. The specialization is untouched too: both bodies fold
//! the whole 93-node tree walk to zero `getfield_gc_r`, both store one mark
//! per node, and both reduce 46 `Char` nodes to 2 `int_eq`. Both compile
//! exactly one loop, and `degraded_dispatch_arms()` is empty for both, so the
//! branching body lowers completely — this is NOT the "refuses to lower"
//! outcome.
//!
//! So the post's "a lot of assembler code generated" is not about the loop
//! body: that gets smaller. It is about what the twenty-six guards go on to
//! cost, which is section 2.
//!
//! Both backends agree op for op on every number in that table, and on the
//! runtime counts below: dynasm and cranelift were measured separately and
//! differ only in the throughput rows.
//!
//! # 2. What majit's runtime then does with those guards. This is the cost.
//!
//! Over a 4096-character non-matching input, the two portals record:
//!
//! ```text
//! branching  guard failures 4080   bridges compiled 10   traces aborted 0
//! masking    guard failures    1   bridges compiled  0   traces aborted 0
//! ```
//!
//! The masking portal is the control and it is the number to read first: over
//! the same 4096 characters it leaves its compiled loop **once**. The
//! branching portal leaves it 4080 times — one guard failure per input
//! character — and it stays one per character even though ten bridges get
//! built. That is the shape of the finding: bridging works here, and it does
//! not catch up.
//!
//! The ten bridges are real machine code and they are entered. Before them
//! every failure in the run reported `tid=1` — the one compiled loop. Now the
//! failures spread across trace ids 1 through 11, the loop and its ten
//! bridges, which is what a bridge failing its OWN guard looks like: the loop
//! covers one path through the mark pattern, a bridge covers the next, that
//! bridge exits at a guard of its own, and the next bridge grows off THAT.
//! `must_compile` fires 10 times and all 10 reach `compile_trace`; none abort.
//!
//! Ten is not a ceiling the bridge tree ran into; it is a rate, and eight
//! times the input is what tells those apart:
//!
//! ```text
//!  4,096 chars:  4,080 guard failures, 10 bridges
//! 32,768 chars: 32,676 guard failures, 84 bridges
//! ```
//!
//! 8.0x the failures, 8.4x the bridges, and the failures stay at 0.997 per
//! character at both lengths. `trace_eagerness` is 200 — `PARAMETERS` carries
//! `rlib/jit.py`'s own default — so one guard must fail 200 times before it is
//! worth a bridge, which caps a pass of `n` characters at about `n / 200` of
//! them no matter how many distinct mark patterns the tree has. Bridging here
//! is not converging on the pattern and stopping; it is trailing it at a fixed
//! rate that the deopt outruns.
//!
//! So the post's "you get a lot of assembler code generated" IS what happens
//! here, once the bridges can be built at all — and it does not pay for
//! itself: the interpreter round trip per character stays, at every length
//! measured.
//!
//! ## What it took to get there, and what it says about majit
//!
//! Until this module was written, NO bridge was built here at all: the same
//! run recorded `guard failures 4090   bridges compiled 0   traces aborted 19`,
//! every one of the 19 aborting on the log line after its tracing session
//! opened, with zero bytecode-body ops walked —
//!
//! ```text
//! [bridgeB] multi-frame resume (7 frames) — only the root frame is seedable,
//!           giving up on the bridge
//! ```
//!
//! `shift` is a recursive `#[jit_inline]` helper, so a guard that fails inside
//! it resumes into a STACK of frames — 4 to 7 of them, the recursion depth at
//! the failing guard — and `start_bridge_tracing` refused whenever a
//! state-field driver's resume data spanned more than one, because
//! `setup_bridge_sym` seeds the root frame only. That refusal would have
//! applied to any `#[jit_interp]` machine whose hot loop calls an inlined
//! recursive helper; the masking portal was not spared it either, it simply
//! has one guard, which does not fail.
//!
//! It is fixed, in `majit-metainterp`, by doing what `resume.py
//! rebuild_from_resumedata` does: push one `MIFrame` per encoded resume
//! section, outermost first, each `setup_resume_at_op(pc)` at its own position
//! with its own liveness-decoded registers, and resume in the innermost one.
//! Two things the resume stream does not carry had to be recovered from the
//! bytecode the way `pyjitpl.py make_result_of_lastop` recovers them: which
//! callee each suspended caller is waiting on, and which of its registers
//! takes the result. `JitCode::inline_call_ending_at` is that read.
//!
//! `MAJIT_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1` now names each rebuilt stack instead of the give-up.
//! One 4096-character run rebuilds 10 of them — one 7-frame, three 6, three 5
//! and three 4 —
//!
//! ```text
//! [bridgeB] rebuild 7 frame(s): [(0, 101, 8), (1, 269, 7), (1, 269, 7),
//!           (1, 269, 7), (1, 269, 7), (1, 214, 2), (1, 131, 4)]
//! ```
//!
//! — jitcode 0 is the mainloop and jitcode 1 is `shift`, so the stack reads
//! directly as "the mainloop called `shift`, which called itself five more
//! times". The distinct `pc`s in the `shift` frames are the distinct call
//! sites: 269 is the recursive descent, 214 and 131 the shallower ones.
//!
//! # Throughput
//!
//! Absolute chars/s on this machine swings by 2x with load — the same binary
//! read 56,208 and 203,740 on the branching row an hour apart — so every
//! number below is either a ratio taken inside one loop or an A/B against a
//! binary built from the same tree minutes apart. A standalone absolute row
//! would not survive being quoted.
//!
//! ## Against RPython's own translated binaries
//!
//! `rpython_original/target.py` and `target_masking.py` are the same two
//! spellings translated with `--opt=jit` and `--opt=2`. Three rounds, each
//! running every binary once in the same loop so a load spike moves all six
//! rows together; each row the median of five timed runs after one untimed
//! warm-up, 1048576 characters at `n = 20`; the table the median of the three:
//!
//! ```text
//!   1,048,576 chars, 93 nodes         majit    RPython jit   RPython C
//!   &/|   jit_interp / target_masking 42,548,721  42,729,349  6,319,695
//!   and/or shortcircuit / target         135,690     555,383  4,514,372
//! ```
//!
//! **On the spelling the post reports, the two JITs are the same speed.** The
//! post's numbers come from the adapted `&`/`|` matcher — part 2 says so — and
//! on that row majit reads 1.00x of RPython. The headline ratio matches too:
//! 42,548,721 / 4,514,372 = 9.4x against RPython's own 9.5x.
//!
//! **On the unadapted spelling both JITs lose to their own C, and this module
//! loses harder.** RPython's `and`/`or` JIT is 8.1x slower than RPython
//! translated to C. "Not particularly fast" is a property of the spelling, not
//! of majit — upstream pays it in the same direction and the same order of
//! magnitude. This module pays it 4.1x harder than upstream does, and that
//! 4.1x is the one number in the table that is majit's own.
//!
//! ## What moved this module's row, and by how much
//!
//! The branching row was 10,154 and 9,407 chars/s when this module was
//! written, at 1-minute load 3.4-50 and 34-83, with the masking row at
//! 17.3M and the no-JIT row at 3.8M in the same two processes — so
//! masking / branching read 1706x and 1848x, and no-JIT / branching 378x and
//! 405x. Profiling that row found two majit defects, each fixed and each
//! measured against a binary built from the same tree:
//!
//! * **The blackhole byte-interpreted `shift`.** `bhimpl_inline_call_*`
//!   (`blackhole.py:1278-1319`) runs `cpu.bh_call_X(adr2int(jitcode.fnaddr),
//!   ...)`: upstream's blackhole calls a callee, it does not interpret it.
//!   `#[jit_inline]` staged its helper jitcode with `fnaddr = 0`, so the whole
//!   ported `bhimpl_inline_call_*` family was unreachable and every deopt
//!   walked `shift`'s 4-to-7-frame recursion opcode by opcode: 2,142 blackhole
//!   ops per character, 319,567 blackhole frames entered over 4096 characters.
//!   With the entry staged the way `call.py:167-169` builds one, 113 ops per
//!   character and 20,236 frames — `bh-setpos == bh-frame`, so not one frame
//!   is entered from `BC_INLINE_CALL` any more. A/B at 4096 characters:
//!   172,269 against 62,900 chars/s.
//!   `shift_carries_the_native_entry_the_blackhole_calls` is the gate.
//! * **`OptContext::inputarg_refs` grew by the parent trace's length on every
//!   bridge.** It holds the canonical `_forwarded` host per InputArg, and it
//!   was a `Vec` indexed by absolute trace position — but a bridge enters with
//!   `inputarg_base = parent_high_water`, so naming one of its inputargs grew
//!   the vector across the whole parent trace, one `Rc` allocation per padding
//!   slot, on every bridge the optimizer ran including the ones it declined.
//!   `sample` put that growth and its matching frees at 56% of the run. A/B at
//!   1M characters: 140,775 against 42,065 for one shared padding `Rc`, then
//!   166,203 against 109,959 — six interleaved pairs, medians — for dropping
//!   the positional `Vec` for a map so the growth term disappears rather than
//!   becoming cheap. `optimizer.py` forwards on the box object
//!   (`op.set_forwarded(newop)`) and keeps no positional side table at all.
//!
//! Neither fix touches how OFTEN the deopt happens, only what it costs: the
//! rate is still 0.997 guard failures per character at 4096 and at 32768. The
//! verdict survives both — the branching portal is still far slower than
//! running the same algorithm with no JIT under it at all, because a character
//! that misses every bridge still pays an interpreter round trip the plain
//! matcher never pays.
//!
//! The in-process ratio the suite runs on every invocation, at 4096
//! characters, moved the same way and for the same reason: 66x, 68x and 89x on
//! dynasm before the multi-frame bridge fix (19x on cranelift), 32x to 51x
//! after it, 12x to 14x now. The masking row has one guard and does not fail
//! it, so it did not move; the ratio fell by what the branching row gained.
//!
//! # The spelling the post's advice suggests literally
//!
//! Swapping `&`/`|` for `&&`/`||` and leaving the shape alone is NOT the A/B
//! this module runs, for two reasons, both measured on this machine in the
//! same session as the tables above.
//!
//! First, in a lowered body `&&` and `||` are not short-circuit operators at
//! all. `opcode_for_binop` maps `BinOp::And` / `BinOp::Or` to `IntAnd` /
//! `IntOr`, so they lower to the same two ops `&` and `|` do, and
//! `lower_bool_if` collapses `if cond { 1 } else { 0 }` back to `cond` with no
//! branch emitted. Measured: with ONLY the `Char` arm rewritten that way, the
//! peeled body carries one guard — the loop exit — exactly as the masking
//! column does. A branch has to be written as a branch whose arms are not the
//! literals `1` and `0`, which is why the arms below hand back the operand,
//! the way Python's `and` / `or` actually evaluate.
//!
//! Second, writing that spelling here is what found a majit defect, now
//! fixed. `(mark != 0) as i64 | (n.marked as i64 != 0) as i64` in the
//! `Repetition` arm made the optimizer die after the trace recorded, on both
//! backends, in `OptContext::getnullness` under `optimize_int_is_true`. The
//! `int_or` of two `int_is_true` results asked about an operand that forwarded
//! to an op whose `Rc` had been dropped: `_forwarded` held a `Weak`, so
//! `get_box_replacement` stopped one hop early and handed back an operand that
//! was still forwarding, which `getnullness` asserts cannot happen. The slot
//! now owns its target the way RPython's `_forwarded` does
//! (`majit-ir/src/forwarding.rs`). Measured after the fix: that spelling in
//! the `Repetition` arm alone, in the `Sequence` arm alone, and in all four
//! arms at once each compiles and agrees with the interpreter on both
//! backends. `majit-ir`'s
//! `operand::tests::a_forwarded_target_survives_every_other_reference_being_dropped`
//! is the gate.
