//! The collector the matcher runs on.
//!
//! **A JIT-enabled RPython build cannot be translated without a GC**, so
//! neither should this crate run without one. `--gc=none` and `--gc=ref` are
//! real translation options (`translationoption.py:65-82`), but they select a
//! `gctransformer` of `"none"`/`"ref"`, and `gc.py:653-662 get_ll_description`
//! resolves `GcLLDescr_<gctransformer>` against a module defining only
//! `GcLLDescr_boehm` (`gc.py:151`) and `GcLLDescr_framework` (`gc.py:313`);
//! anything else raises `NotImplementedError("GC transformer %r not supported
//! by the JIT backend")`. Both descrs that do exist inherit `malloc_jitframe`
//! from the base `GcLLDescription` (`gc.py:132-135`), where it is
//! `jitframe.JITFRAME.allocate` and so `lltype.malloc(JITFRAME,
//! frame_info.jfi_frame_depth)` (`jitframe.py:50`) — a GC allocation, with no
//! arm anywhere that puts a JITFRAME somewhere else. The matcher's own `Regex`
//! nodes are GC objects too. Running majit's side of the comparison with no
//! collector at all made the JIT take a fallback path that no translatable
//! configuration takes: `runner::alloc_jitframe` has nothing to allocate a
//! JITFRAME under, so every compiled entry gets one from the process allocator
//! and frees it on the way out, which on the `and`/`or` row is once per input
//! character.
//!
//! The sequence below is `pyre-jit`'s `init_gc_subsystem` with everything
//! pyre-specific removed — the same four steps
//! `majit-metainterp/tests/allocs_per_compiled_entry.rs` calls "the three calls
//! pyre reaches through `init_gc_subsystem`":
//!
//! 1. store the singleton,
//! 2. register this thread as a mutator (which takes the GIL and holds it),
//! 3. register the JITFRAME shape and publish its type id to the descr —
//!    before the install, because installing freezes the type table,
//! 4. install the backend's `majit_gc::set_active_*` hooks.
