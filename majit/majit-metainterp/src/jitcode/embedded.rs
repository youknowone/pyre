//! A build-time jitcode table and the one descr pool its bodies index.
//!
//! `CodeWriter.make_jitcodes()` (codewriter.py) produces two lists that
//! only mean anything together: `all_jitcodes`, and the single shared
//! `Assembler.descrs` (assembler.py) that every `d`/`j` argcode in every
//! body indexes. A host that runs the codewriter at build time and embeds the
//! two serialized lists in its binary has to join them back into the runtime
//! shapes — `Arc<JitCode>` shells and a `RuntimeBhDescr` pool. This type is
//! that join, and it is the only place the two lists meet.
//!
//! **What the join has to preserve.** A `BhDescr::JitCode` slot names its
//! callee by an `all_jitcodes` index, and the object that index resolves to
//! must be *the* object the table holds at it — `codewriter.py:80
//! all_jitcodes[jitcode.index] is jitcode`, an identity, not an equality.
//! Minting a second shell per pool slot satisfies every read that only wants a
//! body and breaks every read that asks whether two references name the same
//! jitcode: an `Arc::ptr_eq` dedup while flattening a registry sees one callee
//! twice, and an index stamped on one shell is read back off the other.
//!
//! **Why there is no cycle to break.** The shells carry an EMPTY per-jitcode
//! `exec.descrs` and resolve every operand through this pool as the
//! process-global fallback ([`JitCode::descr_at`],
//! [`init_global_build_descr_pool`]). So the pool holds jitcodes and the
//! jitcodes hold nothing — a `BC_INLINE_CALL` chain of any depth resolves
//! against one table. Copying the pool into each shell instead makes the depth
//! the copy was taken at the depth that resolves: the callees inside a copied
//! pool are shells of their own, and whatever pool they were given is the one
//! their own operands read.
