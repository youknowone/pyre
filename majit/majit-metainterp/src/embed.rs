//! Per-run JIT census for an embedder.
//!
//! An interpreter that drives [`JitDriver`] needs to know what its JIT actually
//! did: a green test suite, agreement with the untraced tier and an exact
//! answer are all satisfied by an interpreter that never compiled anything.
//! The evidence lives behind four driver callbacks and a set of process-global
//! diagnostic slots. [`Census`] wires those up once so an embedder does not
//! rebuild the counters, the callback closures and the serializing lock per
//! module.
//!
//! # The window is the point
//!
//! The counters behind this module are process-global and cumulative, because
//! the callbacks are `'static` closures that cannot borrow a caller's local
//! state. An absolute read therefore answers "since this process started",
//! which is not the question a run asks. [`Census::begin`] opens a window and
//! [`Census::counts`] reports the DELTA across it.
//!
//! Two rules make that delta trustworthy, and both were learned from getting
//! them wrong:
//!
//! * The serializing lock is a process-global [`Mutex`], not a `thread_local!`.
//!   Its job is to keep two concurrently running consumers — parallel test
//!   threads, most often — out of each other's window. A thread-local lock is
//!   uncontended by construction and silently does nothing at all.
//! * The cumulative counters are diffed, never zeroed, so a window cannot
//!   destroy an enclosing reader's totals. The "last compiled body" fields
//!   cannot be diffed, so [`Census::begin`] resets those instead — and it holds
//!   the window lock across the reset AND the read, which is what makes that
//!   reset safe. A reset outside a held lock hands each of two overlapping
//!   consumers a fraction of the truth.
