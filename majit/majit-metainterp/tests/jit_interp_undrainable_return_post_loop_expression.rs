//! Ensures a portal whose return type carries no finish projection leaves its
//! post-loop epilogue to native execution.
//!
//! `finish_return_for` recognises the integer and float widths and nothing
//! else, and both drains that keep a lowered epilogue from running a second
//! time — `FinishReturn::drain` after the back edge and
//! `FinishReturn::drain_single_pass` at the single-executor close — are
//! emitted only when it returns `Some`. A `bool`-returning portal gets neither,
//! so lowering its epilogue would publish a FINISH nothing drains: the close
//! breaks the native loop and the suffix runs again, applying its state
//! mutation twice.
//!
//! The sibling `jit_interp_halt_arm_post_loop_expression` covers the same
//! epilogue-once property for the `i64` return that does have a projection.
