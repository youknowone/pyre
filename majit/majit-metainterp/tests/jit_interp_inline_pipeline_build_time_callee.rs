//! An `inline_pipeline_*` call resolves a callee a build-time table already
//! numbered.
//!
//! The three `inline_pipeline_*` call policies name their callee by the call's
//! last path segment and ask the host for it through `__majit_pipeline_jitcode`
//! (`jitcode_lower/lower_value.rs`). Unlike the `inline_*` policies, the
//! returned jitcode is not built here: it comes out of a table the host
//! serialized after running the codewriter, so it already carries the
//! `jitcode.index` its own operands are written against (`codewriter.py:68`).
//!
//! That index is the whole point of this fixture. Installing the dispatch
//! JitCode flattens everything it can inline-call into the flat registry
//! `resume.py:1338-1340` indexes, and the numbering there used to start at 0
//! and stamp every jitcode it discovered. `JitCode::set_index` is set-once and
//! asserts, so the first `inline_pipeline_*` call over a build-time callee
//! aborted the install with `index already set to N, cannot reassign to 1`
//! rather than tracing. Nothing else covers this: the other inline policies
//! build their callee on the spot, so it reaches the walk unnumbered.
//!
//! `greens = []` is deliberate and the macro's empty-green-set report is the
//! expected line for it: what is under test is what the install path does with
//! the callee's index, and no trace is recorded here.
