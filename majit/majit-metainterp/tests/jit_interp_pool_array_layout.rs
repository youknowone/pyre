//! A `pool_arrays` base whose items are not where the descr used to assume.
//!
//! `add_ptr_array_descr` hard-coded `base_size = size_of::<usize>()` and
//! `len_offset = Some(0)` — a `{ len, items.. }` header the declaration never
//! stated and the consumer's struct had to be built to match. Reordering that
//! header, or dropping it, compiled clean on both sides and left the element
//! read at `base + 8 + i*8`.
//!
//! Nothing could have caught it. The struct is the consumer's own, so the
//! macro sees whatever it is handed; no `offset_of!` was emitted, so the
//! assumption never met the layout. The two facts only ever met at run time,
//! as a read of the wrong slot.
//!
//! This machine puts the items LAST, which is the arrangement the old
//! hard-code gets wrong: with a `[i64; 2]` ahead of them, an assumed base of
//! one word reads `items[i]` from inside that padding.
