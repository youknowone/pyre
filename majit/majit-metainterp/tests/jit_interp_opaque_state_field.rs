//! `opaque(T)` carries a field the JIT never enumerates.
//!
//! A state field declared `opaque(T)` keeps its declared type on the state
//! struct and is not a red, a fail arg, or a sym slot
//! (`jit_interp/mod.rs` `StateFieldKind::Opaque`). It exists for carriers
//! whose layout is not flat ints — pools, handles, anything the JIT has no
//! representation for — and the interpreter reaches them directly.
//!
//! The declaration has three consequences, and nothing else covered any of
//! them: the field contributes no red slot, an arm that touches it degrades
//! rather than lowering something wrong, and the state shape is excluded from
//! the generic recursive-portal fresh entry (`codegen_state.rs`) because a
//! fresh frame cannot synthesize an arbitrary `T`.
