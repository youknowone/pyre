//! `__majit_green_key_<fn>` must name the cell the merge point files under.
//!
//! A door outside the mainloop — anything asking "is this position already
//! compiled?" — has to build the merge point's key itself, and before the macro
//! emitted this the only way was to write the layout out by hand: the seed, one
//! `green_uhash_step` per slot, in the order `[target, ..greens]`. A consumer
//! that got a slot wrong still hashed to something, just not to the cell it
//! meant, and the failure is silent and total: the probe answers no forever, so
//! the door never enters an artifact that exists and every counter stays
//! plausible.
//!
//! Asserting the hash against a literal would only pin whatever the helper
//! currently computes. What decides it is the driver: run until a loop compiles
//! at a known back edge, then ask `has_compiled_loop` with the helper's hash.
//! That is the question a door asks, against the key the compiler actually
//! filed.
