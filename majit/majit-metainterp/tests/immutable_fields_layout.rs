//! `_immutable_fields_` must survive the emit-site layout table.
//!
//! The declaration reaches the proc-macro path as a string on the struct, and
//! the layout table is the only channel between that string and the field
//! descrs the optimizer reads.  It carried offsets, widths and pointer-ness and
//! dropped immutability on the floor.
//!
//! Registration order is the interesting part.  A struct's layout accumulates
//! across every emit site that touches it, and not all of them name a declaring
//! struct — a `new_struct` for a transient allocation names none.  So these
//! cover a declaration arriving first, arriving last, and never arriving.
