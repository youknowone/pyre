//! Which `match` in a portal function is the dispatch.
//!
//! `find_dispatch_match` chose the one with the most arms, over every match
//! anywhere in the function body, on the reasoning that a dispatch has many
//! opcode arms and a setup match only a few. Arm count is not a property of
//! being the dispatch. A five-arm `match` beside a three-opcode dispatch takes
//! its place, and then two things happen at once: `classify_arms` reads that
//! match's arms as the opcodes, and the two pre-dispatch walkers — which find
//! their loop by asking which one holds the dispatch match — find no loop and
//! lower nothing. The portal compiles a loop that runs none of the
//! interpreter, and answers with it.
//!
//! Measured here before the fix, on `dispatch_setup_before`:
//! cold 1200, warm 24. 24 is the eight interpreted iterations that reach the
//! threshold; every iteration after that ran the compiled loop, which does
//! nothing. It compiles clean — no degraded arm, no diagnostic, no warning.
//!
//! The arm census is the direct reading: two opcodes means `arms == 2`, and
//! the five-arm setup match would make it 4. The answer is the consequence.
//! Both are asserted, because a machine that stopped lowering altogether
//! would agree with the interpreter by being it.
//!
//! Every machine below is the same interpreter. Only where the setup match
//! sits changes: nowhere, before the loop, inside the loop ahead of the merge
//! point, and after the loop.
