//! **Heap allocations per compiled-code entry** — the instrument for majit's
//! warm entry path.
//!
//! ## Why this exists, and why it is not a `#[test]` in an ordinary file
//!
//! Reading the entry path statically has mispredicted this number twice. The
//! only way to know what a warm entry costs is to count what the allocator is
//! asked for while one is happening, so this file counts it.
//!
//! Four properties are load-bearing and each one is a separate failure mode:
//!
//! 1. **The driver must outlive the measured calls.** A fixture that builds its
//!    `JitDriver` inside the annotated function measures a driver that never
//!    gets warm: every call re-traces from zero and the figure it reports is
//!    the cost of *compiling*, not of *entering*. The fixture below takes
//!    `&mut JitDriver` as a parameter, so `main` binds one driver and calls the
//!    interpreter many times against it — the bind-once/call-many regime the
//!    steady-state cost lives in.
//!
//! 2. **The window must open at the compiled entry.** `MetaInterp`'s
//!    `on_compiled_entry` hook fires at the one point in `back_edge_internal`
//!    where every decline has already returned and the compiled body runs on
//!    the next statement, so one call of the hook is exactly one entry. The
//!    meter reads the allocation counter *in* the hook, which makes the
//!    entry-to-entry delta a measurement of one whole round trip (assemble the
//!    entry arguments, run the artifact, decode the exit, restore the state,
//!    come back round to the next merge point) without needing a second probe
//!    point in production code.
//!
//! 3. **libtest's thread pool races a process-global counter.** This target is
//!    `harness = false` (see `Cargo.toml`), so there is no thread pool and no
//!    second test running beside this one; and the counter that is *reported*
//!    is thread-local, so an allocation made off-thread cannot land in it. A
//!    second process-global counter is kept purely so the difference can be
//!    reported as `off-thread` — evidence that the isolation did something,
//!    rather than an assertion that it did.
//!
//! 4. **A GC must be installed.** The entry path allocates its jitframe from
//!    the nursery when there is a GC to allocate it from and out of the Rust
//!    heap when there is not, and the two differ by a whole allocation per
//!    entry. A fixture with no GC measures a frame shape that no shipped
//!    configuration uses. [`install_gc`] puts the meter on the configuration
//!    pyre and cel run.
//!
//! ## Per-site attribution
//!
//! The counter alone gives a number, not a diagnosis. For attribution the
//! allocator captures a backtrace at each allocation made inside an armed
//! window and buckets it by the innermost majit frame. Capturing a backtrace
//! itself allocates, so a re-entrancy flag routes those straight to `System`
//! uncounted and unattributed — without it the allocator recurses into itself.
//!
//! Attribution runs in its own short window, separate from the counting one:
//! symbolizing a backtrace per allocation is orders of magnitude slower than
//! the entry it describes, and a counted window that slow would be measuring
//! the profiler.
//!
//! ## Running it
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p majit-metainterp --features dynasm --test allocs_per_compiled_entry
//! cargo test -p majit-metainterp --features cranelift --test allocs_per_compiled_entry
//! ```

/// Heap allocations per warm compiled-code entry, as measured by this file.

/// **PER BACKEND, and the two disagree.** The backend is part of the key
/// because it owns the last rows below; pinning one number for both would make
/// whichever leg ran second fail with a message about a regression that is
/// really a configuration difference. The figure was briefly one number for
/// both, before cranelift's frame moved to the nursery.
///
/// Four of the allocations are shared by both backends:
///
/// | n | site |
/// |---|------|
/// | 2 | `CounterState::extract_live_into` — TWO separate `extract_live()` calls, one `Vec<i64>` each: `JitState::extract_live_values`'s default (`jit_state.rs`) calls it and then `live_value_types`, whose default calls it AGAIN. A two-int-scalar state builds each Vec in one allocation (capacity 0→4, no regrowth); the 2 is a doubled traversal, not a regrowth |
/// | 1 | `JitState::extract_live_values` default body in `jit_state.rs` — the `Vec<Value>` it collects into |
/// | 1 | `JitState::live_value_types` default body in `jit_state.rs` — the `Vec<Type>` it collects into |
///
/// Four shared rows have gone since:
///
/// - `<[Type]>::to_vec`, the exit's type list copied out of the failing descr
///   into the exit layout. `CompiledExitLayout::exit_types` is now inline
///   storage wide enough for the exits a steady entry produces, so the copy
///   costs the allocator nothing until an exit is wider than that.
/// - `<[Value]>::to_vec`, the FINISH values copied out of the run result. The
///   FINISH arm returns immediately after publishing them, so nothing reads
///   the source and the values are moved instead.
/// - `run_compiled_detailed_with_values_at_dispatch_key` — `values`, the run
///   result's own machine-word output buffer.
/// - the same function's `typed_values`, its typed twin. Both are now inline
///   storage on the result, sized to the exit widths a steady entry returns,
///   so decoding an exit asks the allocator for nothing. The buffers could not
///   be pooled and reused instead: each one leaves the function owned — into
///   the finish latch, into the public run outcome, into the guard arm's own
///   copy — so there is nothing to hand back.
///
/// ⚠ ALL FOUR ARE A PROPERTY OF THIS FIXTURE'S STATE SHAPE, not of the
/// entry path in general. `codegen_state.rs`'s `generate_state_fields_jit_state`
/// emits the non-allocating
/// `extract_live_values_into` / `live_value_types_into` overrides only when the
/// state has a ref scalar, a float scalar or a virt array; a state of int
/// scalars only — which `CounterState` is — gets neither, and falls back to the
/// allocating `JitState` defaults. A state that clears that gate pays 4 fewer.
///
/// `dynasm` adds one, for 5:
///
/// | n | site |
/// |---|------|
/// | 1 | `majit_backend::jitframe::alloc_off_gc_jitframe` — the JITFRAME itself (`llmodel.py:298 malloc_jitframe`, the ONE allocation upstream makes per entry) |
///
/// It used to add three. The two that went:
///
/// - `raw_values`, a copy of every jitframe slot taken because
///   `DynasmBackend::execute_token` freed the frame before returning.
///   `llmodel.py:240-250` reads those slots out of the frame itself, so the
///   copy had no upstream counterpart; the frame now lives as long as the
///   deadframe does and the accessors read it in place.
/// - the `Box` inside `DeadFrame::Boxed` holding the deadframe
///   `DynasmBackend::execute_token` returns. It held the frame POINTER, not a
///   copy of the frame, and what it bought was type erasure across a crate
///   boundary: `majit-backend` could not name a type declared in
///   `majit-backend-dynasm`. That constraint has no upstream counterpart —
///   `llsupport/jitframe.py` sits below every machine backend and
///   `llmodel.py:271` names `jitframe.JITFRAMEPTR` directly — so the deadframe
///   type moved down into `majit-backend` and `DeadFrame` holds it by value in
///   a variant of its own.
///
/// `cranelift` adds NOTHING, and its four are the four shared rows above.
///
/// There is no cranelift row for the frame itself, and that is the difference
/// between the two backends. `run_compiled_code_inner` takes the JITFRAME from
/// the nursery under its registered type id, which is `jitframe.py:48-52`
/// `jitframe_allocate` — a bump of `nursery_free`, so the frame costs the
/// process allocator nothing. dynasm's `execute_token` (`runner.rs`)
/// allocates its entry frame off the GC unconditionally, so it keeps paying
/// for one; installing a GC does not move its figure.
///
/// It used to add four. The four that went:
///
/// - `deadframe_from_jitframe` — the `Box<JitFrameDeadFrame>` inside
///   `DeadFrame`. The box was not the `llmodel.py:240` `cast_opaque_ptr` it was
///   annotated as; it was a PIN. The deadframe's frame pointer was rooted by
///   registering the address of the field holding it, and a field address is
///   only a valid root while its owner stays put, so the owner had to be given
///   a fixed address before it could be returned. The pointer now lives in a
///   root slot addressed by POSITION (`shadowstack.py:100-106`), which the
///   collector rewrites in place, so the holder may move and `DeadFrame` holds
///   the frame by value.
/// - `CraneliftBackend::execute_token_with_dispatch_key` unwrapped the
///   metainterp's `&[Value]` into an owned `Vec<i64>` before the frame
///   existed. `llmodel.py:306-315` unwraps each argument *at* the store into
///   its frame slot, so upstream never holds a second list; the arguments are
///   now handed down as `FrameInputs::Values` and unwrapped against the frame.
/// - `JitExecResult::extract_outputs` copied every exit slot out of the frame
///   on every exit, and the only two consumers are branches — the
///   CALL_ASSEMBLER sentinel, which reads slot 0, and external-JUMP re-entry.
///   `llmodel.py:240-250` reads slots out of the frame through the accessors,
///   so the copy is now taken only where it is consumed. This is the same
///   removal `raw_values` got on dynasm.
/// - `<i64 as SpecFromElem>::from_elem`, the `Vec<i64>` behind
///   `JitFrameDeadFrame::_heap_owner`. That was the no-GC branch of
///   `run_compiled_code_inner`, reached because this fixture had no GC at all;
///   see [`install_gc`]. The branch itself remains for a backend running
///   without a collector.
