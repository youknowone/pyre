//! An array field is a POINTER field, and both producers that describe it have
//! to say so.
//!
//! Two places in the lowering register a description of the same member.  The
//! array base read (`emit_array_field_base`) registers it as a pointer word:
//! the field holds a buffer base, and the read is a `getfield_gc_r`.  A
//! `residual_writes = { <ref>.<field> => [..] }` declaration — the FIELD form,
//! no `[]` — rebuilds the same layout to mint the write set's descr.
//!
//! `get_field_descr` caches by `(struct, fieldname)` and is cache-OR-mint: the
//! first producer to reach a slot wins, and a later one describing the field
//! differently gets the cached descr back with only a collision counter to show
//! for it.  So a write-set producer that asked the wrong map about the field's
//! kind does not fail; it either loses silently, or wins and leaves every
//! `getfield_gc_r` of that base carrying an Int-typed field descr.  Which of
//! those happens is decided by the order the two producers were emitted in.
//!
//! This fixture pins the write-set producer alone.  Nothing here reads
//! `sel.data[i]`, so the array base producer never runs and the cache slot for
//! `PointerFieldStack::data` holds exactly what the write-set path decided —
//! order cannot mask the answer.
