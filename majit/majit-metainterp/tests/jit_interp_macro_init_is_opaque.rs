//! A `let` whose initialiser is a macro invocation.
//!
//! `lower_local`'s last resort treats an initialiser it could not lower as a
//! compile-time constant: it emits the original `let x = <init>;` verbatim
//! into the surrounding `__builder` block and loads `x as i64` as a constant.
//! That contract holds only while `<init>` names nothing the generated scope
//! lacks, and the guard on it — `expr_touches_storage` →
//! `expr_references_unknown_local` — is what checks that: a bare lowercase
//! identifier is read as a user local and the fallback is refused.
//!
//! The walk had no `Expr::Macro` arm, so a macro invocation fell to its
//! catch-all and reported no reference at all. It cannot know that: the
//! tokens are opaque to it. `let bump = pick!(sel);` therefore passed the
//! guard and put `match sel { .. }` inside `__dispatch_jitcode_*`, whose
//! parameters are the assembler and the driver index:
//!
//! ```text
//! error[E0425]: cannot find value `sel` in this scope
//!   --> tests/...:19:26
//!    |
//! 19 |         let bump = pick!(sel);
//!    |                          ^^^ not found in this scope
//! ```
//!
//! pointing at a line where `sel` plainly is in scope. This file compiling at
//! all is the gate; the assertions below say the refusal is the fail-closed
//! one rather than a silent drop.
