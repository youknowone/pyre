//! One logical stack split between a virtualizable ring and a heap chain
//! reached through a `ref(T)` state field.
//!
//! `jit_interp_two_virt_arrays_runtime_indexed` covers two `[int; virt]` arrays
//! at runtime indices and nothing else: every value it ever reads lives in a
//! box, so the whole machine is answerable without touching memory. That is
//! also its blind spot. A ring only holds the top `CAP` words; a stack deeper
//! than that keeps its remainder somewhere else, and reaching that somewhere
//! else brings in the two things the boxed-only machine never has —
//!
//! * a `ref(T)` state scalar, which shares the flat virtualizable slot space
//!   with the int scalars and the array elements but is carried in the ref
//!   register bank, and
//! * residual calls sitting BETWEEN element accesses, so the boxes have to
//!   survive a call boundary rather than only a guard.
//!
//! The interesting property is that the two halves of the stack are kept
//! consistent by a RED condition (`sp > CAP` / `sp >= CAP`). A trace recorded
//! while the ring alone was enough compiles that condition to a guard and
//! contains no chain traffic at all. Everything about whether the split stays
//! coherent therefore rests on the state the guard restores: if `sp` comes back
//! disagreeing with the chain by even one, the interpreter either pops a chain
//! that is empty or leaks a word into one that should be.
//!
//! So the assertion is not only compiled-equals-interpreted on the sum. The
//! chain must also be empty at the end of the run: every word the ring spilled
//! has to come back exactly once.
