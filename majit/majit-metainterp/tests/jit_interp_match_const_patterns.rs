//! A value-position `match` whose arms name constants.
//!
//! syn parses `TAG_A => ..` and `other => ..` as the same `Pat::Ident`, and
//! `lower_match_value` read every such arm as the catch-all binding. Three
//! constant arms therefore produced NO guarded arms and a `default_arm` set to
//! whichever came last, so the jitcode computed that one arm for every
//! discriminant — while the concrete interpreter, which is real Rust, stayed
//! right. The trace was wrong and only a warm-versus-cold answer could say so.
//!
//! The sibling `lower_dispatch_chain` never had this: it reads its arms with
//! `extract_pat_value_tokens`, which emits `#path as i64` for the user crate to
//! resolve. `lower_match_value` now reads them the same way, and treats a
//! `Pat::Ident` as a binding only when its name holds a lower-case letter.
//!
//! The answer is the subject; the guard census is the denominator. A machine
//! that stopped lowering the arm altogether would agree with the interpreter
//! too — by being the interpreter.
//!
//! The compiled loop, measured:
//!
//! ```text
//! IntAnd GuardValue IntEq GuardTrue IntAdd IntAdd IntSub IntIsTrue GuardTrue Jump
//! ```
//!
//! `IntEq` + `GuardTrue` is the arm the trace took, guarded. Under the old
//! lowering there was no comparison in the body at all. The tags are given
//! non-zero values so that comparison stays spelled `IntEq`: against zero the
//! optimizer rewrites it to `IntIsZero` and the census would have to name both.
