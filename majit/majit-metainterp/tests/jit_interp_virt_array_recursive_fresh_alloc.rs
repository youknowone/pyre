//! A recursive-portal-capable state whose `[.. ; virt]` field is block-backed.
//!
//! The recursive `CALL_ASSEMBLER` portal cannot `New` a host state through the
//! IR, so the generated interpreter emits a pair of host helpers the compiled
//! caller calls residually: one allocates a fresh state sized at the caller's
//! live capacity, the other drops it. That allocator is generated only for the
//! single-virt-array shape declared here — no ref scalars, no float scalars, no
//! opaque carriers and no fixed arrays.
//!
//! The fixture exists because that allocator builds the whole state by struct
//! literal, so each field's initializer has to be spelled in the container the
//! field was declared with. A `[.. ; virt]` field may be declared with either a
//! `Vec` or a block-backed `VirtArray`, and only the block-backed spelling
//! catches an initializer that hardcodes one of the two: with a `Vec` field a
//! `vec![]` initializer compiles whether or not it consulted the declaration.
