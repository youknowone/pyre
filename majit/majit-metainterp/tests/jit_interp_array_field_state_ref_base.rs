//! An `array_fields` base spelled as a `ref(T)` state scalar.
//!
//! `array_fields = { S::f => E }` says the field `f` holds a buffer BASE
//! POINTER, so `<obj>.f[i]` is a `getfield_gc_r` of the base followed by a
//! `get/setarrayitem_gc` on the element. The vocabulary is accepted by both
//! `#[jit_inline]` and `#[jit_interp]`, but `<obj>` can be spelled two ways and
//! only one of them was ever resolved:
//!
//! * a local `ref_params` binding — already materialized in a register, and
//! * `state.<ref_scalar>` — a `ref(T)` state field, which has to be READ out of
//!   the state frame first, and that read emits.
//!
//! Both halves of the lowering handled only the first. On the JIT path
//! `match_array_field_base` required an `Expr::Path`, so the shape matched
//! nothing and the whole arm degraded to an abort stub; a dispatch whose arms
//! all degrade leaves its switch pointing at blocks that were never emitted.
//! On the concrete path `RefFieldRewriter` had no `Expr::Index` arm at all, so
//! the plain-field arms rewrote `<base>.<field>` on their own and left a raw
//! pointer being indexed with `[]` — which does not compile.
//!
//! That second failure mode is why this fixture is worth its length: the
//! concrete half regresses as a BUILD failure, so a test that merely ran the
//! machine would never get the chance to report it. What needs asserting is the
//! JIT half, and the census below is what separates "the trace lowered the
//! element access" from "the arm degraded and the concrete fallback ran and
//! happened to agree". A degraded arm still returns the right number.
//!
//! The read and the write reach the base through two different call sites, so
//! both are exercised. Getting a read to survive at all takes care: at a fixed
//! index it is loop-invariant and gets hoisted, and immediately after a write
//! to the same index it is answered from the store. The machine below walks its
//! index instead, which is also the only arrangement under which the base read
//! has to be redone rather than folded.
