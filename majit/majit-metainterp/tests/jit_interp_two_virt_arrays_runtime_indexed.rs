//! Two virtualizable arrays, each addressed by a RUNTIME index.
//!
//! `virtualizable.py`'s accessors reach an element as "the array's base slot
//! plus the element index", and the base slot of array N is the summed length
//! of arrays 0..N-1 (`get_index_in_array`). One array cannot observe that sum:
//! its base is always the static field count. Two can, and only if something
//! actually indexes the second one at run time — a constant index folds before
//! the sum is ever consulted.
//!
//! The two fixtures that already stand leave exactly this square empty.
//! `jit_interp_virt_array_stack_has_no_memory_ops` indexes ONE array by a
//! running depth; `jit_interp_two_virt_arrays_with_scalar` declares TWO arrays
//! but reaches both at constant index 0. So "two arrays" and "runtime index"
//! are each covered alone and neither is covered together.
//!
//! The shape here is a two-pool stack machine: `vals` is a ring holding each
//! pool's top `CAP` words at `pool * CAP + (h & CAP_MASK)`, and `depths` parks a
//! pool's height while another pool is selected. Both indices are reds. The
//! lengths differ (`POOLS * CAP` against `POOLS`) so a base computed as anything
//! other than the real sum lands inside the wrong array rather than out of
//! bounds, which is the failure that stays silent.
//!
//! The assertion is compiled-equals-interpreted. A cold run pins the answer with
//! the JIT unable to reach its threshold; the warm run must agree.
