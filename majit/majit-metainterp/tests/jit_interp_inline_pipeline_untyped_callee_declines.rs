//! An `inline_pipeline_int` call whose host-resolved callee does not end in a
//! typed return degrades its arm instead of aborting the process.
//!
//! The callee of an `inline_pipeline_*` call is named by the call's last path
//! segment and handed over by the host at install time
//! (`jitcode_lower/lower_value.rs`), so whether its body ends in a typed return
//! is not knowable when the macro runs. When it does not, the parent's
//! `BC_INLINE_CALL` has no return kind to write. That is a rejection, and the
//! lowering has a rejection path: the arm builder answers `None`, the arm
//! degrades to an abort stub with a recorded reason, and every other arm still
//! compiles. `make_jitcodes()` / `pyjitpl.py finish_setup()` install only
//! completed jitcodes; a callee the host resolved badly is not supposed to take
//! the process down.
//!
//! The body below is a bare `void_return`, which is what a host resolving the
//! name to a value-less function hands over. `trailing_return_info()` rejects
//! it, and this fixture pins where that rejection lands.
