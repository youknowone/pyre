//! A field declaration that describes nothing the machine reaches.
//!
//! `int_fields` and `ref_fields` are consulted by key — `"StructType::field"`,
//! built from the *declared* type of the base an access goes through, not from
//! the runtime object. A key naming a struct no access site is typed as
//! therefore matches nothing, emits nothing, and is silently accepted.
//!
//! Both halves of that are the problem. The entry contributes no descr width,
//! so it is dead; and `field_scalar_tokens`' `const _: fn(&S) -> T` witness is
//! emitted only on a match, so the claim it makes about the field is never
//! checked either. Measured on a real consumer: 36 entries declaring a `u32`
//! field as `u8` compiled clean, while the same misdeclaration on a key that
//! *is* consulted produced 13 `E0308`s. An unconsulted entry is not merely
//! untidy — it is a false statement the build agrees to.
//!
//! `pool_arrays` already rejects a base name that resolves to no `ref(_)`
//! state field. This is that check's missing sibling, reporting rather than
//! rejecting for the reason the gate's own message gives.
