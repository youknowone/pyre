//! Where a dispatch match's default arm sends the trace.
//!
//! The unmatched-opcode edge used to be one thing: the label bound at the
//! portal function's trailing return. That is right for `_ => break`, which is
//! what almost every machine in this corpus writes, and it was applied to the
//! other spellings too. `_ => {}` means "fall out of the match and run the next
//! iteration" and `_ => { .. }` means "run this"; both got the return instead,
//! so the walk reported a finished frame, `take_single_pass_finish` broke the
//! native loop, and the portal returned a partial answer.
//!
//! Nothing reported it. `degraded_dispatch_arms()` was empty and the arm
//! census was intact, because from the lowerer's side nothing had refused —
//! the arm was simply never emitted. Measured here before the fix:
//!
//! | default arm        | cold  | warm | compiled body     |
//! |--------------------|-------|------|-------------------|
//! | `_ => {}`          |  1200 |   27 | `[IntAdd, Finish]` |
//! | `_ => { acc += N }`| 41200 |  827 | `[IntAdd, Finish]` |
//!
//! So the answer is the subject, and the loop shape is what keeps the answer
//! honest: an interpreter that never entered the JIT agrees with itself too.
//!
//! Each machine puts an opcode no arm matches into its program. Without one
//! the default edge is never walked and none of this can appear.
