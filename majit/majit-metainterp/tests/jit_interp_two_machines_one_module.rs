//! Two `#[jit_interp]` machines must be able to share one module.
//!
//! Every item the macro emits lands in the CALLER's module. Five of them used
//! to carry fixed names (`__JitMeta`, `__JitSym`, `__jit_loop_carried_boxes`,
//! `__majit_recursive_fresh_alloc`, `__majit_recursive_fresh_free`) while five
//! others were already suffixed with the annotated function's name, so a second
//! machine in the same module failed with E0428 "defined multiple times". Every
//! machine in the tree worked around it by living in its own `mod`.
//!
//! THIS FIXTURE NEEDS BOTH SHAPES, and a green run with only one proves
//! nothing about the other two idents. `__majit_recursive_fresh_alloc` /
//! `_free` are emitted ONLY when `supports_fresh_alloc` holds — zero ref
//! scalars, no opaque carriers, no fixed arrays, and exactly one `[int; virt]`
//! array (`codegen_state.rs` `let supports_fresh_alloc`). So:
//!   * `CounterState` is scalars-only  -> supports_fresh_alloc = FALSE (3 idents)
//!   * `StackState`   has one virt array -> supports_fresh_alloc = TRUE (5 idents)
//! Adding a machine here without checking which side of that predicate it falls
//! on re-opens the hole this fixture exists to close.
//!
//! CEILING, deliberately not tested because it cannot be fixed by naming:
//! two machines over the SAME state type still collide on
//! `impl JitState for #state_type` (E0119). Unique idents buy co-residence only
//! for machines whose `state` types differ.
