//! A residual call that sits after a red-conditional branch inside one opcode
//! stops running once a bridge is compiled for that branch.
//!
//! The interpreter shape is the smallest one that can hold the defect: a single
//! scalar state field, one opcode whose body is `if <red condition> { <call> }`,
//! and a back edge. Nothing here is exotic — no virtualizable array, no virtual
//! object, no exception path — so any `jit_interp` interpreter with a
//! conditionally-effectful opcode is in range.
//!
//! What the run must produce is arithmetic, not a crash. `OP_PUSH` hands the
//! displaced word to `chain_push` on every trip past `CAP`, so after `N` pushes
//! the chain has seen exactly `N - CAP` words and their sum is fixed. Both are
//! computed twice: once with the threshold out of reach, which fixes the
//! answer, and once warm.
//!
//! It measured 202 of 1992 before the fix, with `N = 2000` and `CAP = 8`: the
//! 202 are the trips before the branch earned a bridge, and from the bridge
//! onwards the call never ran again. `MAJIT_NO_BRIDGE=1` and
//! `MAJIT_MAX_BRIDGES=0` both made it pass, which placed the loss in bridge
//! tracing rather than in the guard, the recovery layout or the blackhole
//! resume.
//!
//! The mechanism is a position mismatch. The failing guard's resume state is
//! mid-opcode — its failargs carry `sp` ALREADY incremented, so the point it
//! describes is after `state.sp = state.sp + 1` and before the call.
//! `JitDriver::start_bridge_tracing` seeds the bridge with
//! `state.build_meta(resume_pc, env)`, and `resume_pc` is a green pc, which can
//! only ever name an opcode BOUNDARY. So the bridge begins at the next opcode
//! and the tail of the one that failed — here the call, and the store after it
//! — is never recorded. `resume_in_blackhole` does not have this problem
//! because it resumes at a jitcode position rather than a pc, which is why
//! turning bridges off repairs the count.
