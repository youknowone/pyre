//! A virtualizable too large to number must abandon the compile, not compile a
//! guard that has no resume data.
//!
//! `resume.py` raises `TagOverflow` once a livebox index no longer fits
//! the tag's 13 value bits, and `optimizer.py:761-766
//! store_final_boxes_in_guard` answers it with `raise compile.giveup()` — the
//! whole compilation is abandoned and the interpreter keeps running from state
//! it never handed over. Every element of a virtualizable array is a distinct
//! livebox (`resume.py _number_boxes`), so a long enough declared
//! length reaches that limit on its own.
//!
//! What makes this a correctness test rather than a capacity one: the failure
//! is silent. A guard emitted without resume data still compiles, and the
//! damage appears only when it later fails and the deopt rebuilds interpreter
//! state out of an empty numbering. The interpreter then resumes with values
//! that are not the ones it had, so the machine's own arithmetic — not any JIT
//! statistic — is what witnesses it.
