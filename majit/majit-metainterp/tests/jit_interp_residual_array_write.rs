//! is served from `OptHeap`'s separate array cache and reads a value from
//! before the call.  The `[]` suffix declares the ELEMENTS instead.

//! This fixture holds the declaration to the descr it must produce.  The shape
//! it has to carry is pinned by `array_write_set_invalidation.rs`; what is
//! tested here is that the declaration reaches the emitted call at all.
