//! A `#[jit_inline]` helper that calls itself.
//!
//! `codewriter.py CodeWriter.make_jitcodes` emits one JitCode per graph and
//! links callees by index; `CallControl.get_jitcode` mints and caches an empty
//! JitCode under the graph BEFORE the body is written, so a graph that calls
//! itself links to the object it is already registered under. Nothing here did
//! that: the inline lowering emitted a plain Rust call to the helper's builder,
//! so `f` calling `f` recursed until the stack was gone — at jitcode-BUILD
//! time, during warmup, before any tracing.
//!
//! It is not a caching problem. `add_sub_jitcode` pushes an `Arc<JitCode>` into
//! the CURRENT builder's own descr pool, so direct self-recursion asks for a
//! jitcode whose pool holds an `Arc` to itself. The identity now comes from
//! `Arc::new_cyclic`, and the self-edge is recorded as a `Weak` — which is what
//! keeps it from being a cycle of owning references that never drops.
//!
//! Reaching the first assertion at all is the first result: before this, the
//! process died in `dispatch_sum(..)` with a stack overflow.
//!
//! The compiled loop, measured (identical on dynasm and cranelift): four
//! `value` reads and four `next` reads in the preamble, no call of any kind.
