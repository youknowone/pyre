//! A dispatch arm may call a result-returning inline helper for its effect.
//!
//! `inline_int` / `inline_ref` / `inline_float` helpers were lowered in value
//! position only. In statement position — the result discarded — they reached
//! the trailing `_ => return None` of `lower_config_call_stmt`, and a statement
//! that does not lower takes its whole arm with it: the arm becomes an abort
//! stub and every trace that reaches the opcode aborts, forever.
//!
//! Two things made that hard to see. `explicit_call_emits_post_live` already
//! answers for these three kinds, so the accounting said the policy was handled
//! while the lowering did not handle it. And the workaround is invisible in the
//! result — binding the value to a `let _x` the arm never reads makes the same
//! source lower, so a machine that hit this looks like one that never did.
//!
//! `#[jit_inline]` fails the build on the same input
//! (`jit_interp_inline_helper_typed_return.rs` pins that half). `#[jit_interp]`
//! does not: it degrades the arm and keeps going, which is why this file
//! grades the registry rather than the compiler.
