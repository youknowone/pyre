//! A field declared on an inlined leading substructure, reached through the
//! structs that embed it.
//!
//! `rclass.py:548` builds every instance struct as `MkStruct(name, ('super',
//! rbase.object_type), *own_fields)`, and `rclass.py:987-1001
//! InstanceRepr.getfield` resolves a field against the repr that OWNS it,
//! recursing to `self.rbase` with `force_cast=True` when it is not its own.
//! `jtransform.py:881` therefore always reads the descr off the declaring
//! struct, which is what gives one physical field one descriptor across a whole
//! family. `inlined_prefix` is that relationship declared to the macro.
//!
//! **What makes this file a gate is that it compiles at all.** `Prefixed` and
//! `PrefixedWithTail` below have no `head` and no `size` field: those words
//! live in the `Header` each embeds, and Rust knows it. Every access in the
//! machine spells `state.<ref>.head`, so without the redirect the expansion
//! emits `(*(p as *mut Prefixed)).head` on the concrete arm and
//! `offset_of!(Prefixed, head)` on the JIT arm, and this crate fails to build.
//! An empty assertion list would still be a real test here; the assertions
//! below cover what compiling alone does not.
//!
//! The two structs are deliberately different sizes — 16 and 24 — because the
//! point of the mechanism is that they keep their own identities and their own
//! sizes while SHARING the descriptors for the words they have in common.
