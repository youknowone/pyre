//! `_immutable_fields_` on a `#[jit_interp]` machine, end to end.
//!
//! The plumbing tests next door assert that the declaration reaches the minted
//! descr.  That is necessary and not sufficient: what the declaration is FOR is
//! `OptHeap::optimize_getfield`'s fold, which fires only when the descr is
//! always-pure AND the base is a constant.  A chain of reads is where the two
//! meet — promote the root once and each declared read folds to a constant,
//! which makes the NEXT read's base constant too, so the whole walk collapses.
//!
//! So this is an A/B: two structurally identical machines over two structurally
//! identical node types, differing only in whether `left` is declared.  Without
//! the declaration each level costs its own `getfield_gc_r`; with it, none do.
//!
//! The undeclared machine is the denominator, and it is asserted FIRST. A low
//! read count is also what a census over a trace that was never recorded
//! produces, and a fixture that cannot fail in the other direction has not
//! measured the fold.
//!
//! The two optimized traces, as measured:
//!
//! ```text
//! declared: Label GetfieldGcR GuardValue GetfieldGcI IntAdd IntAdd IntSub
//!           SetfieldGc IntIsTrue GuardTrue | Label IntAdd ... Jump
//! plain:    Label GetfieldGcR GuardValue GetfieldGcR GetfieldGcR GetfieldGcI
//!           IntAdd IntAdd IntSub SetfieldGc IntIsTrue GuardTrue | Label ... Jump
//! ```
//!
//! One `GetfieldGcR` per link without the declaration; with it, only the read
//! whose base is the red `state.root` survives and the two below it are gone.
