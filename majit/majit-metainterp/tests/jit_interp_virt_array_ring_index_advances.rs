//! A virtualizable ring whose index ADVANCES, spilling every evicted word to a
//! chain reached through a `ref(T)` state field.
//!
//! `jit_interp_virt_array_spills_to_ref_chain` covers the same split stack, but
//! its program returns to the same depth every iteration, so the ring slot each
//! access reaches is the same on every trip. A vable array's index is promoted,
//! and a promoted value that never changes is free: the guard is recorded once
//! and passes forever. That is the blind spot. A stack that only grows reaches
//! a DIFFERENT slot each trip, so the promote's guard fails every iteration,
//! and each failure has to resume at the boundary of the opcode that computed
//! the index — before the eviction the same opcode still owes the chain.
//!
//! It measured 201 of 1992 before the fix. It is the virtualizable-array face
//! of the defect
//! `jit_interp_bridge_drops_opcode_tail` reproduces with one scalar field, and
//! it is kept because the ring is what makes the guard fail EVERY trip: the
//! promoted index is a different value each time, so the branch behind it never
//! settles.
//!
//! What makes a missed resume invisible without this fixture is that nothing
//! observable goes wrong at the moment it happens: the ring keeps answering,
//! the chain stays internally consistent, and the loop keeps running. Only the
//! COUNT of words that reached the chain records it. So the assertion is
//! arithmetic on the whole run rather than a crash: after `N` pushes the chain
//! must hold exactly `N - CAP` words, and their sum must be the sum of the
//! first `N - CAP` values pushed — one skipped eviction changes both.
