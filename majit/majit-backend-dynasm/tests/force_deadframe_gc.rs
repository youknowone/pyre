//! A forced frame's live `Ref` slots must survive a collection taken while the
//! run that owns the frame is still executing.
//!
//! `force` (`llmodel.py:270-274`) casts the force token to a jitframe, resolves
//! it, stamps `jf_descr` and hands that frame straight back — it does not copy
//! anything out. So the deadframe it mints BORROWS: the frame is still on the
//! JF shadow stack, still owns its `jf_forward` chain, and still carries the
//! `jf_gcmap` the call site stored (`aarch64/callbuilder.py:70-73` calls
//! `aarch64/assembler.py:993-998 push_gcmap`, which writes the map into
//! `jf_gcmap` before the call; `pop_gcmap` at `assembler.py:1000-1003` is what
//! zeroes it again, and that only runs once the call has returned). Everything
//! such a deadframe's own lifetime does must therefore be nothing. Releasing
//! the chain would free memory the compiled code is running on, and nulling
//! `jf_gcmap` would stop the frame's trace after its five header words
//! (`jitframe.py:115-116` returns early on a null map), leaving every live
//! `Ref` slot of a still-executing frame unforwarded.
//!
//! All three tests below compile `force_token` -> `call_may_force` ->
//! `guard_not_forced`, with two `Ref` values live across the call so the
//! register allocator spills them into gcmap-covered frame slots. The called
//! helper forces the frame. The two probe objects are also held by registered
//! GC roots, so the collector moves them and names their new addresses, and
//! every read — through the borrowed deadframe and through the guard exit that
//! follows it — has to agree with those roots.
//!
//! The first two differ only in where the deadframe drops relative to the
//! collection, and that is the whole point:
//!
//! * `borrowed_deadframe_reads_the_forwarded_refs_across_a_collection` keeps
//!   it alive across the collection, covering the read path.
//! * `dropping_a_borrowed_deadframe_leaves_the_running_frame_traceable` drops
//!   it FIRST and collects afterwards, so the only thing standing between the
//!   frame's `Ref` slots and the collector is what that drop did to the frame.
//!   A minor collection promotes every surviving nursery object, and promoted
//!   objects do not move again, so a collection taken before the drop cannot
//!   witness a drop that damages the frame. Only this ordering can.
//!
//! The third, `owned_deadframe_registry_roots_the_returned_frames_refs`, moves
//! the collection past the point where the run RETURNS, and so covers the
//! other deadframe constructor. `execute_token` mints its result with
//! `LibcJitFrameDeadFrame::owning`, which OWNS the chain; by then the compiled
//! epilogue's `gen_footer_shadowstack` has popped the frame off the JF shadow
//! stack, so the reason the borrowed cases stayed traceable is gone. What is
//! left is `LIVE_DEADFRAMES`, the registry `owning` inserts into and `Drop`
//! removes from, published to the collector as a root source. That test walks
//! the registry to show the frame is in it and walks the JF shadow stack to
//! show it is in nothing else, and only then collects.
