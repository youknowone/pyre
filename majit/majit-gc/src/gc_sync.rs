//! gc_sync — Stop-the-world safepoint protocol for free-threading GC.
//!
//! Provides the synchronisation harness around incminimark's collection.
//! Mutators run in parallel; collection pauses all of them via STW.
//! The collector code (`do_collect_nursery`, `do_collect_full`) runs
//! unchanged inside the STW window — it already assumes a single-threaded
//! world during collection.
//!
//! # The operation gate is the GIL
//!
//! GC operations (alloc, collect, barrier, query) take no lock of their own.
//! Exclusion comes from [`crate::rgil`]: a thread holds the GIL for as long as
//! it runs pyre code, so between two external calls arbitrarily many
//! allocations run with no synchronisation, and [`gc_op`] is a bare borrow of
//! the singleton — `malloc_fixedsize` bumps `nursery_free` under exactly the
//! same terms (incminimark.py, framework.py:361-402).
//!
//! The GIL is therefore the safepoint too. A thread that does not hold it is
//! either waiting for it in `RPyGilAcquireSlowPath` or blocked in an external
//! call, and both leave the RUNNING census — so a collector, which by
//! definition holds the GIL, never waits for a thread that is running pyre
//! code.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Collection begins only when every other registered thread is at an
//! entry-style safepoint where all of its live GC references are rooted.
//! Waiting for the GIL and entering an external block are both such
//! safepoints; a dispatch poll parks directly. There is no exit safepoint: a
//! returned reference remains protected until the caller roots it before its
//! next collection-capable call.
