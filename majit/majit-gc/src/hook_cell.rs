//! Process-global fn-pointer hook cells.
//!
//! [`FnPtrCell`] is the free-threading replacement for a
//! `thread_local! { static X: Cell<Option<fn(..)>> }` GC hook. Before the GC
//! became a process-global singleton (`gc_sync`), each thread could own a
//! distinct GC and installed its own hook fn pointers; now every thread
//! installs the *same* pointer, so the per-thread copy is redundant and — for
//! a collector that may run on an arbitrary thread — unsound (a thread that
//! never ran the install path would collect with the hook unset).
//!
//! The value is a bare `fn(..)` pointer, which is thin and pointer-sized, so
//! it is stored bit-for-bit in an [`AtomicPtr<()>`] with the null pointer
//! standing in for `None`. This keeps the read side a single acquire atomic
//! load plus a null check — no lock, no heap — matching the cost of the TLS
//! access it replaces on the allocation hot path.
//!
//! Registration mirrors [`crate::shadow_stack::register_extra_root_walker`]:
//! the hooks are process-global constants fixed once at boot (the runtime
//! substitute for RPython's translation-time weaving against a global
//! `gcdata`). Overwrite and clear (`None`) remain supported because the test
//! harness installs mock hooks and resets them; production installs each hook
//! exactly once under a `Once`.
