/// collecting calls a *fixed* frame slot (`gc_save_root` /
/// `gc_restore_root` into the same index). The LIFO shadow stack is only
/// the `push_roots` / `pop_roots` bump around one call
/// (`framework.py`); `CurrentFrameGuard` and the JIT `FrameRoot` truncate
/// that stack with `pop_to`. A long-lived RAII handle therefore cannot
/// share it: a nested frame that pops, or `release` compacting a hole,
/// would hand the index to a later push and `Deref` would reload that
/// later value as `_digits`.
///
/// [`majit_gc::shadow_stack::acquire_owner_root`] is that fixed-slot vector.
/// Replacing a live guard (`z = RBigIntGcRoot::new(...)`) acquires a new
/// slot and drops the old one; in-place replacement of the handle must
/// go through [`RBigIntGcRoot::set`] so the same slot names the new
/// digit array. Assignment through [`DerefMut`] updates only the local
/// `_digits` pointer and leaves `_size` paired with the previous array —
/// as does a `&mut self` method that installs one, which is why
