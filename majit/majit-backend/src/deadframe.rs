///   the allocator nothing after the first few calls.
/// * [`FrameHeapOwner::OWNED`] is the probe arm: `vec![0i64; words]` in, free on
///   drop. One `calloc`/`free` pair per entry.
///

/// type stands in for. `jitframe_allocate` builds the frame out of the GC
/// nursery, which is a bump allocator with no per-frame release at all — that
