# Eager IR compilation

`majit_backend::eager::CompiledIr` (also `majit::eager::CompiledIr`) submits
backend-ready IR immediately, without a recorder, sample execution, hot counter,
or `MetaInterp`. Backend selection stays with the embedding: the same entry point
accepts `&mut dyn Backend` for dynasm, Cranelift, or another implementation.

This is an in-process compilation API, not an object-file writer, CEL compiler,
generic CFG compiler, or automatic substitute for the tracing frontend. A
frontend still owns language lowering, optimization if wanted, typed operands,
call descriptors, guards, and control-flow targets. Backend support for an IR
operation is unchanged; backend compilation errors propagate to the caller.

## Lifecycle

1. Configure the backend's existing runtime, GC and completion/exception
   descriptors, then call its ordinary `setup_once`. A backend already configured
   by the embedding needs no second setup. `CompiledIr` never installs a different
   collector, reattaches descriptors, or calls setup/teardown behind the caller.
2. Supply a fresh `Arc<JitCellToken>` from the embedding's existing unique token
   namespace, input arguments in call order, backend-ready operations, and a
   `ConstMap`. `unsafe CompiledIr::compile(...)` compiles immediately. A caller
   supplying raw machine-level IR is responsible for its validity; the API is
   not a verifier for untrusted IR.
3. Reuse `unsafe compiled.execute(&values)` for different inputs. Arity and types
   are checked before entry. `RawExecResult` preserves finish/guard/exception
   classification and exit values. A guard is not silently resumed, retraced or
   reported as a successful language evaluation. Pointer inputs and returned
   references remain subject to the embedding's GC/rooting contract.
4. The handle keeps the token alive and exclusively borrows the backend; it
   cannot move to another execution thread. Drop it before reconfiguring or
   using that backend directly. Retain an `Arc` clone of the token to use the
   existing `compile_bridge`, `execute_token`, or invalidation APIs afterward.
   Backend and runtime teardown remain the embedding's responsibility.

The submission replaces the pending backend constant pool and clears it after
success or error. Do not interleave a partially staged lower-level compilation
with this API. A backend may partially populate a token before returning an
error; retry with a fresh token, not the failed token.

Standalone embeddings can share the metainterpreter's descriptor factory:

```rust,ignore
majit_backend::make_and_attach_done_descrs(&mut [cpu as &mut dyn Backend]);
cpu.set_propagate_exception_descr(Arc::new(majit_backend::PropagateExceptionDescr::new()));
cpu.setup_once();
```

Use this only when initially configuring a CPU, not before each compilation.
The factory creates the five completion/exception descriptors and shares their
identities across its targets; it does not install a collector, replace the
propagate-exception descriptor, or run setup. The metainterpreter's original
`compile::make_and_attach_done_descrs` signature remains as a forwarding wrapper.

See the module's compiled rustdoc example for an integer `add_one` unit. Native
conformance tests use directly constructed `Op`/`Operand` graphs, not even a
test recorder, and cover changing inputs, guard exits, mixed argument banks,
scalar result banks, void results, rejected arguments, host calls, and reuse
through the pre-existing backend API.

## Cost and scope

The execution path still uses `execute_token_raw`: the ordinary JITFRAME entry
and result decoding remain. Eager compilation removes warmup and runtime trace
discovery; this API does **not** claim to remove the measured per-call entry
cost, binding cost, GC overhead, or actual host-function invocation cost. A
dedicated low-overhead scalar ABI is separate work.

For a CEL frontend, short-circuiting, errors, dynamic types and host side effects
must survive lowering. Compiling an example input and treating the observed path
as the whole program is not a valid implementation of this API's frontend.

## Compatibility boundary / parity review

This is a user-authorized embedding extension with no new counterpart module in
RPython. The underlying contract is `rpython/jit/backend/model.py`
`AbstractCPU.compile_loop` / `execute_token`; upstream's
`rpython/jit/backend/test/runner_test.py` `Runner.execute_operations` likewise
compiles supplied operations without a metainterp. This is not limited to
upstream tests: `rpython/jit/metainterp/compile.py` `compile_tmp_callback` directly
assembles a call/exception-guard/finish sequence through `cpu.compile_loop` too.

The descriptor factory and its `DescrContainer` contract now live beside the
existing descriptor classes in `majit-backend::finish_descrs`; their upstream
owner remains `compile.py` `make_and_attach_done_descrs`. This crate-placement
adaptation allows standalone embeddings to reuse them without depending on the
metainterpreter. Dynasm's existing test initializer also uses this factory.

Existing
`Backend` methods and concrete code generators, PyPy interpreter generation,
optimizer passes, GC layout, token identity, guard descriptors and resume
machinery are unchanged by this API addition. Pre-existing worktree changes in
the Cranelift entry allocator and JitDriver fixture are not part of this addition.

Native conformance command:

```sh
cargo test -p majit-backend-dynasm -p majit-backend-cranelift --test eager --no-default-features
cargo test -p majit-backend --doc --no-default-features
```

The shared API has no native-backend feature gate. This test command executes
the host's native backends; it does not establish wasm guest execution support
for a new frontend. Wasm retains its existing host-import/browser runtime setup
and operation support contract.
