# CPython-suite gap: test_sys and test_io read `sys.stdout.encoding` only
# through `PYTHONIOENCODING`, and the vendored suites never compare the
# unnamed answer against the host's own code page.
# parity-tests reason: `initstdio` took PyPy's `_WIN32 and not encoding`
# shortcut on every host, so a redirected stream opened as utf-8 where
# `config_get_locale_encoding` answers the ANSI code page -- a script whose
# output is piped into a Windows tool wrote bytes that tool cannot read.

# pyre-check: pypy-diverges: pypy3 runs with `sys.flags.utf8_mode == 1`, so
# its own answer is utf-8 by the rule below rather than in spite of it.
