# CPython-suite gap: test_ctypes never reads a py_object back after a
# collection, so nothing there reaches a relocated target.
# parity-tests reason: this guards a pyre/PyPy moving-GC allocation invariant.
# pyre-check: pypy-diverges: its container slot is zero-based, so `repr` of a
# fresh py_object raises IndexError on an empty table and answers the first
# stored object once one exists (measured on PyPy 7.3.20)

"""``ctypes.py_object`` must survive the collector relocating its target.

A ``_SimpleCData`` buffer is ``malloc_raw`` memory: the collector neither
traces it nor rewrites it.  Storing the target's address there is therefore
only correct while nothing moves, and a ``list`` header is an ordinary movable
allocation.  ``GlobalPyobjContainer`` is upstream's answer -- the buffer holds
a table slot, and the table is a real object the root walk forwards.
