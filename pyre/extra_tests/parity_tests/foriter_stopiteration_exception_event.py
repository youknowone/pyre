# pyre-check: pypy-diverges: callable-iterator sentinel exhaustion reports a consuming-frame StopIteration event
# CPython-suite gap: `test_sys_settrace` traces loops and it traces raising
# code, but never a loop whose iterator ends by raising StopIteration from a
# Python-level `__next__` while a tracer is installed.  A runtime that
# swallowed that StopIteration without reporting it would pass the whole
# module.
#
# parity-tests reason: FOR_ITER's exhaustion arm catches the StopIteration and
# jumps, so the consuming frame never dispatches it and never reaches the
# code that reports an exception to the tracer.  Whether an `exception` event
# is delivered there is therefore a decision the exhaustion arm has to make on
# its own, and it is one a debugger sees: `pdb` stops on `exception` events.
#
# The rule is not "always" and not "never".  3.14 reports the event exactly
# when the StopIteration carries a traceback -- which is to say, when it was
# raised by Python code rather than signalled by an iterator implemented
# natively.  A list ending, a range ending and a dict ending all deliver
# nothing; a class whose `__next__` raises delivers one.  That asymmetry is
# what this pins: reporting always would fire on every `for` over a list, and
# reporting never would lose the one case a debugger cares about.
#
# A generator's ending carries no traceback and is the other half of the rule:
# an event is reported because the iterator is a generator.  3.14 answers a
# cold loop differently -- the first execution runs the unspecialised
# `_FOR_ITER`, whose exhaustion arm jumps past `END_FOR` without reporting,
# and only once the loop specialises to `FOR_ITER_GEN` does the end arrive at
# `INSTRUMENTED_END_FOR` where `monitor_stop_iteration` mints it.  So the
# warm loop is what is pinned here: it is the answer 3.14 settles on, the
# answer pypy3 gives from the first call, and the only one of the two that
# does not depend on which tier is running.
