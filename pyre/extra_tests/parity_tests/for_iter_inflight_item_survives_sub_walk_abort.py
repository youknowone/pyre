# CPython-suite gap: the loss is a jit walk-abort path, invisible to an interpreter-level suite.
# parity-tests reason: pins a consumed FOR_ITER item against an abort inside a nested inline callee.

"""A FOR_ITER item consumed before an aborted sub-walk still reaches the body.

`step` is a bound method that mutates before it calls, so the walk admits it as
an inline callee and the append commits; `rec` is self-recursive, so descending
into it is refused and the walk aborts with the item already taken off the
iterator. Redelivering it would replay the append, so delivery is refused
whenever a body effect has committed -- which leaves the abort itself owing the
item a carrier. Without one the item is neither delivered nor rolled back, and
the loop body runs for it while its value never lands in `res`: the failure
signature is `len(res) < len(w.seen)`.

The accumulator is a statement loop, so no LIST_APPEND is involved and what is
pinned is the item rather than the opcode that accumulates it. The trip counts
are the ones the loss was observed at -- the walk has to warm up before the
abort is reached, and a shorter sweep never reaches it.
