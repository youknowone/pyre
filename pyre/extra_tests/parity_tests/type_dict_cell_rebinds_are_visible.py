# CPython-suite gap: no suite test rebinds a class attribute twice and then
# keeps reading it in a loop hot enough to compile.  The second rebind is the
# one that matters here, and only the second.
#
# `typeobject.py W_TypeObject.setdictvalue` routes every class-namespace store
# through `write_cell`.  The store that replaces the class-body value builds an
# `ObjectMutableCell` and calls `mutated()`, which revokes `_version_tag` here
# and in every subclass.  Every store after that writes `w_value` inside the
# installed cell, `write_cell` returns `None`, and `mutated()` is skipped -- so
# no version tag moves.
#
# parity-tests reason: a trace that answers a class-namespace lookup under a
# version-tag pin alone is therefore correct until the first rebind and wrong
# from the second on, which shows up as a wrong number rather than as a missed
# optimisation.  The fix is upstream's own shape -- read
# `ObjectMutableCell.w_value` off the pinned cell with a `getfield` and guard
# what was read -- so each case below is a rebind the compiled code must see.
#
# Every rebind happens INSIDE its loop: a store after the loop is interpreted
# and would not consult what the trace baked.  The store sits after the read,
# so iterations `0..=SWITCH` read the first value and the rest read the second.
