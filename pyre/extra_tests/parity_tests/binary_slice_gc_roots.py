# CPython-suite gap: the vendored suite slices sequences with plain integer
# bounds, so no test in it runs Python between the receiver's type test and the
# fetch that reads its payload.
# parity-tests reason: this is a pyre/PyPy moving-GC root-liveness regression.

"""``seq[a:b]`` must survive a bound ``__index__`` that collects.

``BINARY_SLICE`` converts each bound through ``__index__`` -- arbitrary
Python, so a collection point -- and only then fetches out of the receiver.
The ``list`` / ``str`` / ``tuple`` arms each read the receiver again after
that conversion, and the arity-2 specialised tuples box their payload on
every fetch, so the receiver moves inside the fetch loop as well.
