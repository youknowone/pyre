# CPython-suite gap: test_weakref's threaded copy tests reach this only when a
# collection happens to land while one of their threads is starting.
# parity-tests reason: `_thread.start_new_thread` and `start_joinable_thread`
# hand the new thread its callable and arguments while the starter waits with
# the GIL released.  A collection another thread runs in that window moves
# nursery-born objects, so the hand-off travels through roots the collector
# forwards (os_thread.py `Bootstrapper`) rather than addresses the new thread
# reads afterwards.
# parity-env: PYPY_GC_NURSERY=64k

"""A thread starts with its own callable and arguments while another collects.

A churn thread allocates without pause, so collections keep running while the
main thread starts workers.  Each worker's callable is a fresh bound method and
its arguments are fresh objects, all born in the nursery, and each worker
records what it received.
