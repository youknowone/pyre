# pyre-check: pypy-diverges: prompt finalization at close() is a refcount
# boundary; pypy3's tracing GC reaches the delegate's local later
# CPython-suite gap: test_yield_from closes delegating generators, but never
# with a local whose finalizer is the observable, so nothing there grades when
# the delegate's `__del__` runs relative to the outer `close()` returning.
# parity-tests reason: one `close()` finishes every frame in the `yield from`
# chain, and pyre carries a single pending-finalizer census from the frame
# teardown out to `descr_close`. The delegate is finished first, so a census
# that is assigned rather than accumulated loses its answer to the delegating
# frame's own.

"""`close()` on a delegating generator runs the delegate's finalizer.

The object's only reference is a local of the *inner* frame, so it becomes
garbage when `close_yield_from` finishes that frame -- before the outer frame
is finished. CPython's refcount boundary runs `__del__` there, and `close()`
does not return until it has.
