# CPython-suite gap: re's tests pass plain ints for `pos`/`endpos`, so nothing
# there runs user code between acquiring a buffer subject and matching on it.
# parity-tests reason: this is a pyre/PyPy moving-GC root-liveness regression.
# A buffer subject (a `memoryview`, an `array.array`) is gathered into a fresh
# `bytes` that the subject slice points into and that a match or a scanner then
# stamps into its own fields; converting `pos`/`endpos` runs `__index__`
# between the two, and the gathered object has no other owner.
# parity-env: PYPY_GC_NURSERY=4096
