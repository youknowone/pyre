# pyre-check: platforms=linux,darwin
# CPython-suite gap: test_os.FwalkTests.test_fd_finalization only grades the
# fwalk generator's own descriptors.  On a tracing GC, `close()` that pays a
# whole-heap collect also runs `__del__` of unrelated FileIO left by earlier
# tests, so `getfd()` drops below the snapshot and the assertion reads
# `3 != 6`.
# parity-tests reason: `os.fwalk` holds an exhausted `scandir` iterator at the
# topdown yield.  `W_ScandirIterator.fail` / `_close` (interp_scandir.py) is
# what makes that iterator's finalizer a no-op; without `may_ignore_finalizer`
# the prompt-finalization census still sees it and collects the heap.
