"""End-to-end gate for the interpreter's own pip, resolved entirely offline.

Drives a release pyre binary through the sequence a user performs when they
install something:

    -m venv  ->  ensurepip  ->  pip install (wheel)
             ->  pip install (PEP 517 build, isolated)
             ->  console script  ->  metadata  ->  uninstall

Every artefact comes from the checkout: the pip wheel `ensurepip` bundles, and
the setuptools wheel under `lib-python/3/test/wheeldata` that the suite's own
venv helpers glob for.  Nothing is resolved from an index, so the gate cannot
fail because a package server is slow, and it cannot pass because a stale
wheel was lying in a cache.  One check spends a second proving exactly that,
before the first check that resolves anything: a plain `pip download` of a
name only an index can answer has to fail.

This lives beside `snippets/` and `parity_tests/` rather than in them because
it is one long stateful sequence -- the build in a later check consumes the
archive an earlier one wrote -- and because it needs a per-check timeout an
order of magnitude above what a snippet gets.

The reference CPython is not in the gating set: pip succeeding there says
nothing about pyre.  It is used only as a control, and only after something
has already failed, to separate "pyre broke" from "the fixture rotted".

Usage:
    python3 pyre/extra_tests/pip/run.py [--dynasm-only|--cranelift-only]
                                        [--with-network] [--keep]
                                        [--no-cpython-control]
                                        [--timeout SECONDS]

Exit code is 0 iff every (backend, check) pair passed.
