//! The bridge-carrier drain must decide "too deep to compile" before it runs
//! the callee, not after.
//!
//! `drive_bridge_carrier_walk` drives a reconstructed inline callee as a
//! sub-walk and keeps only a clean `SubReturn`. Every other outcome falls to an
//! abort tail whose non-adopted leg calls `fbw_store_journal_rollback()`. That
//! rollback restores the journals and nothing else: a residual call's heap
//! writes move the effect odometer and push no journal entry, so they stand
//! while the blackhole replays the region that produced them, and the replay
//! applies them a second time.
//!
//! The carrier-depth cap is one predicate that used to be read *after* the
//! sub-walk, in `want_compile`. A carrier over the cap therefore ran the callee
//! and then took that rollback. Before recursive carriers were separated from
//! pyre's generic call-chain cap, lowering the cap made this program reach that
//! arm and corrupt its accumulator rather than crash:
//!
//! ```text
//! PYRE_FBW_MULTIFRAME_DEPTH=1  ->  acc: got 262173, want 578965
//! ```
//!
//! `PYRE_FBW_MULTIFRAME_DEPTH` is a supported knob (`fbw_state.rs`, clamped
//! 1..7). PyPy `_opimpl_recursive_call` bounds recursion only with
//! `max_unroll_recursion`, so recursive carriers now bypass pyre's additional
//! generic cap. This fixture pins both that bypass and the original safety
//! property: no abort may roll back over effects the drain already executed.
//!
//! Do not invoke Cargo from this test: the parent `cargo test` holds the target
//! directory lock. `CARGO_BIN_EXE_pyre-dynasm` supplies the binary Cargo already
//! built for this integration test.

// `pyre-dynasm` is `required-features = ["dynasm"]`, so under
// `--no-default-features` the binary does not exist and `CARGO_BIN_EXE_…` is
// unset -- a compile error rather than a skip. Compile this file to nothing in
// that configuration instead.
