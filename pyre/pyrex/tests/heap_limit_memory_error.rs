//! A bounded heap surfaces as a `MemoryError` before it aborts.
//!
//! incminimark.py's module docstring states the `PYPY_GC_MAX` policy as a
//! ladder: the GC *"will first collect more often, then raise an RPython
//! MemoryError, and if that is not enough, crash the program with a fatal
//! error"*. The middle rung is the only one a program can act on, and
//! `major_collection_step` is where upstream raises it.
//!
//! Pyre reaches that rung differently, and this test exists because the
//! difference is invisible to any unit test. Upstream's `raise MemoryError`
//! unwinds out of whichever driver ran the collection; pyre's collections are
//! mostly driven from the dispatch-loop safepoint, which returns `()` and
//! cannot raise, so the collector defers the exception through the eval-breaker
//! word and the dispatch loop raises it. Only an end-to-end run exercises that
//! hand-off — a collector unit test can assert the flag and a dispatch-loop
//! unit test can assert the raise, and both can pass while nothing joins them.
//!
//! What is asserted, and what is deliberately not. The middle rung's promise is
//! that the limit *becomes a Python exception*; it is not a promise that the
//! program survives one. After the first breach the live set is by definition
//! at the limit, so anything the program does next can reach the rung below —
//! upstream says as much where it raises, and aborts on the second arrival for
//! exactly that reason. So the exception itself is the observable, and nothing
//! downstream of it is: no `except` clause, no marker the program prints, no
//! particular exit status.
//!
//! That rules out running the program as `-c`, and the reason is worth
//! recording because two CI rounds were spent on it. The exception reaches the
//! interpreter's own traceback printer, which is a handler like any other:
//! `eprint_exception` renders the whole report into a buffer and writes nothing
//! until it is complete. For a `-c` program the filename is `<string>`, so
//! `frame_source_line` falls past its filesystem branch into
//! `read_registered_source_line`, which calls app-level `linecache` — a nested
//! dispatch loop whose first safepoint drives a whole major cycle over a heap
//! the breach left at its limit. The abort unwinds out of the half-built buffer
//! and stderr receives nothing at all. Read from a real file the same program
//! prints its report, because `read_source_line` answers from the filesystem
//! and no Python runs between the raise and the write. Measured on both, while
//! both raise, deliver, and reach the printer identically.
//!
//! An `except MemoryError` in the program is no better, and that is what the
//! second round established: `os._exit` is about as small as a handler gets,
//! and it still lost the race on two of three hosts, because the exception
//! object's own allocation re-arms the collection request and the next
//! safepoint breaches again before the handler's first call returns.
//!
//! `--heapsize` rather than `PYPY_GC_MAX` because it also covers the launcher
//! plumbing (`take_heapsize_option` -> `gc_set_max_heap_size`), which the env
//! var bypasses.
//!
//! Do not invoke Cargo from this test: the parent `cargo test` holds the target
//! directory lock. `CARGO_BIN_EXE_pyre-dynasm` supplies the binary Cargo already
//! built for this integration test.

// `pyre-dynasm` is `required-features = ["dynasm"]`, so under
// `--no-default-features` the binary does not exist and `CARGO_BIN_EXE_…` is
// unset — which would be a compile error rather than a skip. Compile this file
// to nothing in that configuration instead.
