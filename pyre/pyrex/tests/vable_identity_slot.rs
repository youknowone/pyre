//! A traced frame must never store an operand into the virtualizable identity.
//!
//! `virtualizable_boxes` is laid out `[static fields][array slots][identity]`,
//! and the trailing identity entry is the box `_nonstandard_virtualizable`
//! compares every later vable op against. A store that lands on it does not
//! corrupt one value — it renames the standard virtualizable, after which the
//! compiled trace writes `PyFrame` fields into whatever object the store
//! carried and dereferences that object's `locals_cells_stack_w`.
//!
//! The reachable producer was STORE_DEREF: its codewriter lowering read the
//! cell with the LOAD_FAST *opcode* (a `getarrayitem_vable_r` plus a
//! `pushvalue`) while its own operand still occupied the top of the stack, so
//! the scratch push addressed one slot past `co_stacksize` — exactly the
//! identity entry. A class body is the shape that reaches it with no headroom:
//! `class C: def m(self): pass` compiles to `co_stacksize=1` with a single
//! `__classdict__` cellvar, and `STORE_DEREF __classdict__` runs with the
//! `LOAD_LOCALS` result on the stack.
//!
//! The failure is a SIGSEGV inside JIT-generated code with nothing on stdout or
//! stderr, so this test scores the **exit status**. A harness that only
//! inspected output would call the crash a pass.
//!
//! The trip count has to clear the function-entry trace threshold (~1619), so
//! it is deliberately well above it rather than tuned to it.
//!
//! Do not invoke Cargo from this test: the parent `cargo test` holds the target
//! directory lock. `CARGO_BIN_EXE_pyre-dynasm` supplies the binary Cargo already
//! built for this integration test.

// `pyre-dynasm` is `required-features = ["dynasm"]`, so under
// `--no-default-features` the binary does not exist and `CARGO_BIN_EXE_…` is
// unset — which would be a compile error rather than a skip. Compile this file
// to nothing in that configuration instead.
