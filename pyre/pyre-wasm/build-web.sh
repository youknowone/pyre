# Build the browser (web / wasm-bindgen) flavour of pyre-wasm and stage the
# artefacts that www/index.html loads.
#
# Both the `web` and `wasmi` builds of this single crate emit to the shared
# target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/pyre_wasm.wasm path, so a later build
# of the other flavour (or check.py, which builds wasmi) overwrites it. This
# script snapshots the web output to a feature-distinct pyre_wasm.web.wasm
# immediately and feeds that snapshot to wasm-bindgen, so the deployed module
# never depends on the shared path surviving. (check.py does the mirror image
# for wasmi -> pyre_wasm.wasmi.wasm.)
#
# Requires: the wasm32-unknown-unknown rustup target and wasm-bindgen-cli
# (`cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli`, matching the crate's wasm-bindgen version).
