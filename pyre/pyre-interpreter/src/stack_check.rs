//! Stack overflow protection — RPython rstack parity.
//!
//! Port of `rpython/rlib/rstack.py stack_check()` +
//! `rpython/translator/c/src/stack.c:25 LL_stack_too_big_slowpath`. The
//! four primary entrypoints match RPython's `LL_stack_*` C ABI so the
//! JIT backends can call them from emitted code:
//!
//!   * [`pyre_stack_get_end`] — captured stack base (high address; stacks
//!     grow downward). Raw read, returns 0 when never captured.
//!   * [`pyre_stack_get_length`] — effective stack budget in bytes.
//!   * [`pyre_stack_set_length_fraction`] — multiply `MAX_STACK_SIZE` by
//!     `frac`, clamp to the OS stack, and store the result as the new
//!     effective length.
//!   * [`pyre_stack_too_big_slowpath`] — four-case slow path: first-time
//!     capture, thread-switch cache refresh, stack-underflow base
//!     revision, real overflow.
//!
//! The JIT-addressable state lives in the global [`PYRE_STACKTOOBIG`]
//! matching RPython's `rpy_stacktoobig_t` struct (`stack.h:23`), so
//! `pyre_stack_get_end_adr` / `pyre_stack_get_length_adr` can hand out
//! stable addresses for backend-emitted inline probes. The source of
//! truth for `stack_end` however is a thread-local mirror
//! [`TL_STACK_END`] matching `pypy_threadlocal_s::stack_end`
//! (`stack.c:30`); the slow path reads the TLS value first and refreshes
//! the global cache from it on a thread switch (`stack.c:49`), then
//! writes both when the base is newly captured or revised
//! (`stack.c:63-64`). The requested stack length remains process-global;
//! only its safety clamp uses the current thread's actual OS stack size.
//! That is genuine thread state, and the slow path refreshes the same
//! backend-visible global cache that RPython uses.
//!
//! `sys.setrecursionlimit(N)` calls `pyre_stack_set_length_fraction(N *
//! 0.001)` and stores `N` as the visible recursion limit. The default
//! recursion limit is 1000, matching CPython/PyPy.
//!
//! [`stack_check`] is the Rust-side inline fast path. The JIT prologue
//! emits the equivalent inline sequence directly (see
//! `rpython/jit/backend/x86/assembler.py:1080
//! _call_header_with_stack_check`).

/// frames are bigger get the larger budget instead. pyre applies the

/// / 1000` ([`pyre_stack_set_length_fraction`]), so this constant is
/// exactly "bytes for 1000 Python call levels" and has to cover the
/// most expensive level pyre can produce.
///
/// A level the interpreter runs costs ~1.7 KB of native stack
/// (`funccall_valuestack` → `OpcodeStepExecutor::call` → `eval_loop_jit`
/// → `eval_with_jit`). A level that enters compiled code and leaves it
/// through a guard failure costs ~6.3 KB, because the resume chain
/// nests on the native stack once per level:

/// → `blackhole_resume_via_rd_numb` → `BlackholeInterpreter::run` →
/// `handler_residual_call_r_r` → `bh_call_fn`. `48 << 18` is twice what
/// 1000 such levels need, which keeps the byte budget above the
