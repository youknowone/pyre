//! Global Interpreter Lock — `pypy/module/thread/gil.py`.
//!
//! The lock itself lives in `majit_gc::rgil` (the `rpython/translator/c/src`
//! side). What this module adds is the half that belongs to the object space:
//! a thread holds the GIL for as long as it runs pyre code, so without a
//! periodic hand-off a compute-bound thread would never let another one run.
//! `GILReleaseAction` is that hand-off — an action registered on the ticker
//! which yields the GIL every `sys.getcheckinterval()` bytecodes.
