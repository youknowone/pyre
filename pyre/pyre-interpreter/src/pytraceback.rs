//! `pypy/interpreter/pytraceback.py PyTraceback` line-by-line port.
//!
//! ```python
//! class PyTraceback(baseobjspace.W_Root):
//!     def __init__(self, space, frame, lasti, next, lineno=LINENO_NOT_COMPUTED):
//!         self.space = space
//!         self.frame = frame
//!         self.lasti = lasti
//!         self.next = next
//!         self.lineno = lineno
//! ```
//!
//! Upstream `frame` is an ordinary traced field of an ordinary movable
//! instance: `pytraceback.py self.frame = frame` on a
//! `baseobjspace.W_Root`, pointing at `pyframe.py class
//! PyFrame(W_Root)`, which declares no `_alloc_flavor_` and is never
//! pinned — `rpython/rlib/rgc.py` documents `pin` as a
//! short-lived-buffer facility that does not extend lifetime, and
//! nothing under `pypy/interpreter/` calls it.  A minor collection
//! copies the frame (`rpython/memory/gc/incminimark.py`) and
//! rewrites every referring slot in place (`:2252`), because roots
//! reach the collector as slot addresses
//! (`rpython/memory/gctransform/shadowstack.py`) and compiled
//! code re-reads the frame after each collecting call
//! (`rpython/jit/backend/x86/assembler.py`).
//!
//! Pyre's `PyFrame` does carry the `PyObject` prefix (its `ob_header`
//! field), so `tb_frame` returns a Python-visible object.  What
//! diverges is the slot type: this struct holds a raw `*mut PyFrame`
//! rather than a `PyObjectRef`, and the edge reaches the collector
//! only through the hand-written `pytraceback_object_custom_trace`
//! hook, which forwards it as a mutable slot.
//!
//! The pointee must additionally never move.  That is not an upstream
//! requirement and nothing in this file causes it: an executing frame
//! is reached through a live Rust `&mut PyFrame` that spans every
//! allocation the running opcode performs, and RPython's translator
//! rewrites exactly those live references in their shadow-stack slots
//! (`rpython/memory/gctransform/shadowstack.py`) where Rust has
//! no equivalent pass.  `FrameBox::new` allocating non-moving stands
//! in for that rewrite, and this file's conditional frame edge and
//! `w_code` snapshot are downstream of it.
//!
//! The rule holds for frames that reach here, not for every frame: a
//! compiled trace's own inlined-callee frame is a nursery allocation,
//! and making that uniform times `fib_recursive` out of its gate, so
//! the crossing is guarded at the seams instead (see `gate-triage.md`).
//! `record_application_traceback` is one of those seams.
