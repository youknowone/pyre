//! Thread state and the GIL -- PyPy `cpyext/pystate.py`.
//!
//! A thread holds the GIL for as long as it runs pyre code, so an extension
//! that blocks has to give it up (`PyEval_SaveThread`, which
//! `Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS` expands to) and one that calls in from a thread of
//! its own has to take it (`PyGILState_Ensure`).  Both are the runtime's own
//! boundary guards; [`crate::module::thread`] owns them, because a build
//! without this layer exports `PyGILState_Ensure` and `PyGILState_Release` too
//! -- cffi's embedding header calls them.
//!
//! `PyThreadState` is opaque.  Upstream keeps one per execution context and
//! records whether it is the current one (`pystate.py PyThreadState_Get`,
//! `:228 PyThreadState_Swap` through `ec.cpyext_threadstate_is_current`); the
//! same pair here is per thread, since that is what an extension can name.
