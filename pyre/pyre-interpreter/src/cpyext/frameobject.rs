//! Frame mirrors -- PyPy `cpyext/frameobject.py`.
//!
//! A frame is the one interpreter object whose mirror carries fields of its
//! own.  Everything else this runtime defines is exactly a [`CPyObject`], and
//! an extension reaches its contents through calls; a frame is different
//! because an extension builds one itself and then writes its line number,
//! which is a field assignment no entry point stands in for.
//!
//! The block therefore has to be [`CPyFrameObject`]-sized rather than
//! `PyObject`-sized, which is what [`basicsize`] tells the allocator through
//! `tp_basicsize`.  Getting that wrong is not a failure that reports itself:
//! the writes below would land past the end of a 24-byte block.  [`fields`] is
//! the one place that turns a mirror into a frame mirror, and it refuses on a
//! block that was not sized for one.
