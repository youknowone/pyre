//! `PyJitCode`: pyre's per-CodeObject JitCode wrapper.
//!
//! RPython's `JitCode` (jitcode.py:9) is a single class that owns
//! both the bytecode (`code` / `constants_*` / `c_num_regs_*`) and
//! the per-graph metadata (`name`, `fnaddr`, `calldescr`,
//! `jitdriver_sd`). pyre still has a split runtime representation:
//!
//!   * `majit_metainterp::jitcode::JitCode` is the current runtime
//!     adapter bytecode container (`code`, `constants_*`, `num_regs_*`,
//!     plus pyre-only `exec.*` pools). It is not the canonical
//!     codewriter `majit_translate::jitcode::JitCode`.
//!   * `PyJitCode` (this struct) wraps that JitCode together with
//!     pyre-only translation metadata — `pc_map` (Python PC → byte
//!     offset), `merge_point_pc`, the runtime `w_code` wrapper, and
//!     register layout — that RPython
//!     does not need because RPython's bytecode PCs are already
//!     JitCode PCs.
//!
//! The struct lives in `pyre-jit-trace` (the lower crate) so that
//! both the codewriter (`pyre-jit::jit::codewriter`) and the
//! trace/blackhole runtime (this crate) can hold the same
//! `Arc<PyJitCode>` instances. RPython's `MetaInterpStaticData.jitcodes`
//! list and `CallControl.jitcodes` dict reference identical
//! `JitCode` Python objects via Python's reference semantics; pyre
//! mirrors the shared-identity part with `Arc<PyJitCode>`. The wrapped
//! runtime `JitCode` allocation is also kept stable when the codewriter
//! fills a shell, because `inline_call_*` descriptors hold the callee
//! `JitCode` object itself in the RPython model.
//!
//! ## Discriminator: 3-state mode mapping
//!
//! A `PyJitCode` is one of three modes, encoded across two flags:
//!
//! | mode             | `jitcode.code` | `metadata.pc_map` | predicate                |
//! |------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
//! | Skeleton         | empty          | empty              | [`PyJitCode::is_skeleton`]       |
//! | PortalBridge     | non-empty      | empty              | [`PyJitCode::is_portal_bridge`]  |
//! | PerCodeObject    | non-empty      | non-empty          | [`PyJitCode::is_populated`]      |
//!
//! `code` and `pc_map` are independent because the portal-bridged
//! install ([`crate::canonical_bridge::install_portal_for`]) reuses
//! the canonical portal `JitCode.code` byte stream but skips the
//! per-Python-PC mapping (the portal dispatches via its own arms on
//! `pycode.instructions[pc]`). Drained CodeWriter installs do both:
//! fill real instructions into `code` and stamp `pc_map` to
//! `code.instructions.len()`. Skeletons have neither because they are
//! placeholder slots inserted by `CallControl::get_jitcode` before the
//! assembler drain runs.
//!
//! The fourth combination (`code` empty, `pc_map` non-empty) is not
//! produced by any production path; the predicates classify it as
//! neither Skeleton nor PortalBridge nor PerCodeObject. Test fixtures
//! that fabricate this combination (e.g. by calling [`PyJitCode::skeleton`]
//! and then pushing into `metadata.pc_map`) flow as PerCodeObject for
//! [`PyJitCode::is_populated`] purposes (the historical predicate
//! looks at `pc_map` only).
//!
//! Convergence path: RPython's single `JitCode` class has neither flag
//! to consult — `assembler.assemble` populates `code` in place and
//! per-PC mapping is implicit in the bytecode stream. pyre will lose
//! the dual-mode discrimination once the codewriter routes Python
//! bytecode through the canonical RPython codewriter pipeline (Phase
//! G.4.4+). Until then, the mode mapping above is the source of truth
//! for every reader that branches on install style.
