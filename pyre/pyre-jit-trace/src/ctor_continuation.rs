//! `typeobject.py descr_call`'s JIT-visible tail, as a resume level of its own.
//!
//! Upstream, a guard inside an inlined `__init__` resumes into a framestack
//! that still holds `descr_call`'s own frame: `capture_resumedata`
//! (`pyjitpl.py`) hands the whole `self.framestack` to the trace, and
//! `convert_and_run_from_pyjitpl` (`blackhole.py`) copies every frame into a
//! chained blackhole interpreter.  `descr_call` is an ordinary graph there, so
//! the three things it does after the call —
//!
//!   1. discard `__init__`'s result,
//!   2. raise `TypeError` unless that result was `None`,
//!   3. return `w_newobject`,
//!
//! — are just its jitcode, and the blackhole runs them with no special case.
//!
//! Pyre cannot reuse that graph, and this module is the ADAPTATION that
//! stands in for it.  The counterpart of `descr_call` is
//! `pyre-interpreter/src/call.rs type_descr_call_impl`, and two independent
//! things keep it from playing the level:
//!
//!   1. Pyre never *enters* it.  `try_walker_inline_type_call`
//!      (`jitcode_dispatch/inline_call.rs`) recognises `C(...)` while decoding
//!      the CALL and synthesises the body itself — it resolves `__new__` and
//!      `__init__` off the type, emits the allocation through
//!      `helpers::emit_instance_inline`, and inlines only `__init__` as a user
//!      call.  No pc inside `type_descr_call_impl` is ever current, so no
//!      resume coordinate can name one.  This is the same divergence
//!      `find_all_graphs_bfs` already documents for the builtin gateways:
//!      pyre's opcode walker lowers a Python CALL directly instead of through
//!      the source-level dispatch graph.
//!   2. The graph is not in the frozen table either.  The build-time
//!      `find_all_graphs` BFS from the `eval::eval_loop_jit` portal stops
//!      above it — `call_function_impl_raw` is present, its callee
//!      `call_function_impl_result` is not — so the whole type-call spine
//!      below that cut is absent.
//!
//! CONVERGENCE PATH: (2) is a seed away — `find_all_graphs_bfs` already takes
//! explicit extra seeds — but fixing it alone changes nothing, because (1) is
//! what decides that the graph is never run.  Converging means retiring the
//! opcode-level recogniser and inlining `type_descr_call_impl`'s generated
//! jitcode as an ordinary callee frame, the way upstream traces through
//! `descr_call`.  Then `__init__` is a frame inside a frame, the discard and
//! the None check are that graph's own jitcode, and this module deletes.
//! Until then the stand-in is deliberately the smallest thing that can hold a
//! resume coordinate: three ops, entered only by resume, never compiled.
//!
//! Without such a level the constructor route cannot be seeded at all.  A
//! blackhole level's return kind is decided by the `*_return` op the callee
//! executes, so a seeded `__init__` returns `Ref` and `_setup_return_value_r`
//! (`blackhole.py`) writes its `None` into the caller's call-result register —
//! the register that has to hold the instance.  That is why the constructor
//! inline used to pin itself to the caller boundary instead.  (The callee-body
//! replay-safety scan in `fbw_state.rs` stays: its other caller decides
//! FOR_ITER-in-flight admission, which is a rewind question, not a deopt one.)
//!
//! The level is recorded the way upstream's is: as one of the paused levels
//! on `__init__`'s framestack entry (`InlineFrame::parents`, outermost-first),
//! not as a value the snapshot splices in at a fixed offset.  That is what
//! keeps it at its own depth when `__init__` itself inlines a callee — the
//! chain becomes `caller -> tail -> __init__ -> callee`, which is exactly what
//! `capture_resumedata` would hand over upstream.
//!
//! So this module builds the tail, and only the tail, as its own jitcode:
//!
//! ```text
//!   0:          inline_call_r_r <placeholder>, self -> init_result
//!   resume_pc:  -live-                       [r0 live, r1 pending]
//!               residual_call_r_v  bh_check_init_returned_none(init_result)
//!               ref_return         instance
//! ```
//!
//! The level is only ever *resumed*, never entered from the top:
//! `blackhole_from_resumedata` sets each level's `position` from its resume
//! section, and `run_this_frame` dispatches forward from there.  The
//! `inline_call` before the anchor therefore never decodes — it exists because
//! `call_result_reg` reads *backwards* from `position` to find where a
//! returning callee's value goes, and `BC_INLINE_CALL`'s three-slot return
//! tail (`return_i`, `return_r`, `return_f`, each a register or
//! `NO_RETURN_REG`) is the shape that read recognises.  Its callee operand is
//! a placeholder for the same reason: the byte is never read, and the real
//! callee varies per class while this jitcode is shared.
