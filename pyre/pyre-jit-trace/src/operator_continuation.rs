//! The JIT-visible TAIL of an operator that post-processes a dunder's result,
//! as a resume level of its own.
//!
//! `crate::ctor_continuation` solves this for `descr_call`; read its module
//! doc first, because the mechanism, the register discipline and the
//! "entered only by resume" contract are identical.  This module generalises
//! it from one operator to a table of them.
//!
//! The defect it answers: a fold that inlines an app-level dunder under an
//! operator is sound only while the operator's result IS the callee's return
//! value.  `a[k]` through `__getitem__`, `GET_ITER` through `__iter__` and a
//! property's `fget` are identity, so they need nothing.  `len(o)` is not —
//! `operation.py len` is
//!
//!   1. `w_res = space._len(w_obj)`        (the `__len__` call),
//!   2. `w_index = space.index(w_res)`,
//!   3. `space._check_len_result(w_index)` (>= 0, and it fits a machine word),
//!   4. answer `space.newint` of that machine length.
//!
//! The fold emits 2-4 into the TRACE, and a guard failure inside the inlined
//! `__len__` never reaches them: `BhFrame::call_result_reg` is
//! `code[position - 1]`, so `_setup_return_value_r` (`blackhole.py`) writes
//! the callee's raw return straight into the result register of the CALLER's
//! `len` residual, and the caller resumes at `call.next_pc` — past the whole
//! operator.  `len(o)` then answers `-1` instead of raising `ValueError`, and
//! `True` instead of `1`.
//!
//! Upstream has no such gap because `len` is an ordinary graph on the
//! framestack, so `capture_resumedata` (`pyjitpl.py`) hands it over with
//! everything else and the chained blackhole simply runs steps 2-4.  Pyre's
//! walker recognises the operator at the opcode instead of entering that
//! graph, exactly as `try_walker_inline_type_call` recognises `C(...)`, so
//! the tail has to be spelled out:
//!
//! ```text
//!   0:          inline_call_r_r <placeholder> -> dunder_result
//!   resume_pc:  -live-                        [nothing live, r0 pending]
//!               residual_call_r_r  bh_len_tail(dunder_result) -> answer
//!               ref_return         answer
//! ```
//!
//! Pushed as a paused parent level under the caller (`InlineFrame::parents`,
//! outermost-first), so the chain is `caller -> tail -> __len__ -> ...` and
//! the tail keeps its own depth when the dunder body inlines a callee of its
//! own.  The never-decoded `inline_call` exists only so `code[position - 1]`
//! names the register the finished dunder's return lands in; its callee
//! operand is a placeholder because the instruction never executes and the
//! real callee varies per class while this jitcode is shared.
//!
//! The tail's own `ref_return` then feeds the CALLER's `call_result_reg` —
//! the `len` residual's destination — with the operator's finished answer,
//! which is what makes the deopt observationally identical to never having
//! inlined anything.
//!
//! CONVERGENCE PATH: the same as `ctor_continuation`'s.  Entering
//! `builtins::builtin_len`'s generated jitcode as an ordinary callee frame,
//! with the `__len__` call inlined at the `get_and_call_function` inside it,
//! makes steps 2-4 that graph's own jitcode and deletes this module.  The
//! blocker is documented on `try_walker_orthodox_descent`: a mid-descent
//! decline does not rewind an effect the sub-walk already executed.
