//! The runner links no pyre crate — it is a wasmtime host that reaches the
//! counters through the `pyre_fbw_diag` wasm export — so it cannot import the
//! authority and instead restates it as a positional array. Each side sizes
//! its own value array from its own labels, which catches a slot added
//! without a name; neither compiler sees the SPELLINGS, so a rename drifts
//! silently and every tally from the divergence onward is printed under the
//! wrong key. Hence this test: the authority is LINKED (`fbw_diag::LABELS` is
//! in scope), the mirror is read out of the runner's source as text, the same
//! way `majit-metainterp/tests/runner_label_mirrors.rs` does for `MC_DIAG_LABELS`.
