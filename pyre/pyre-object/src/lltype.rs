//! `lltype.malloc` parity API — unified allocation lowering for pyre objects.
//!
//! Mirrors RPython's `lltype.malloc(T, flavor='gc')`
//! (`rpython/rtyper/lltypesystem/lltype.py:2192`), the user-facing
//! allocation primitive used throughout PyPy's interpreter
//! (`pypy/objspace/std/intobject.py wrapint` etc.). In RPython's
//! translation pipeline, every `lltype.malloc(T)` call is rewritten by
//! the GC transform (`rpython/memory/gctransform/framework.py:803-853
//! gct_fv_gc_malloc`) into a managed allocation surrounded by
//! `push_roots` / `pop_roots`:
//!
//! ```text
//! v_alloc = direct_call(malloc_fast_ptr, c_const_gc,
//!                       c_type_id, c_size, ...)
//! # bracketed by push_roots(hop) / pop_roots(hop, livevars)
//! ```
//!
//! pyre has no equivalent transform stage today — its host code is
//! plain Rust compiled by cargo. This module provides the same API
//! shape (the low-level allocation primitive that the GC transform
//! consumes; PyPy interpreter source-level constructors like
//! `pypy/objspace/std/intobject.py wrapint` are plain
//! `W_IntObject(x)` calls and `lltype.malloc` only emerges from the
//! rtyping stage `rpython/rtyper/rclass.py:731`) so that:
//!
//! 1. Object constructors are single allocation calls without
//!    per-callsite TLS hooks or conditional branches.
//! 2. Future GC integration replaces the body of [`malloc`] without
//!    changing any caller.
//!
//! Current body: [`majit_gc::header::alloc_with_gc_header`] — the
//! `malloc_fixedsize` analog that prepends a [`GcHeader`] (type id,
//! `flags=0`) and returns the payload pointer, so the write barrier reads a
//! valid header instead of foreign memory. The GC owns the header
//! (incminimark defines its own `HDR`); the object model delegates and stays
//! header-agnostic. These objects are still leaked host allocations; routing
//! them through the nursery allocator with root push/pop is the remaining
//! GC work.
//!
//! [`GcHeader`]: majit_gc::header::GcHeader
