//! Trapping the machine-level exceptions a foreign call raises.
//!
//! A structured exception is delivered by the OS through a chain of frame
//! handlers, not by anything the language runtime unwinds, so a foreign
//! function that reads address 0x20 does not return an error to its caller —
//! it takes the process down unless a `__try`/`__except` further out claims
//! it.  `_ctypes_callproc` has that `__try` around `ffi_call`
//! (`callproc.c:950-959`); [`guard`] is the same fence with the call it wraps
//! written in Rust, and [`exception`] is `SetException`.
//!
//! Everywhere else the fence is nothing: a POSIX fault arrives as a signal and
//! the same call raises no structured exception at all.

/// Run `body` inside the fence, reporting a structured exception it raised as
/// the OSError `SetException` would have set.
