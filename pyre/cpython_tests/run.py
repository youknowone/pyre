"""Run the vendored CPython regression suite against a pyre binary.

This mirrors PyPy's `lib-python/conftest.py` mechanism: each CPython test
module is run in its OWN subprocess of the built interpreter, the vendored
test files carry PyPy's own modifications and nothing else, and every
pyre-specific expected-status / skip decision lives in an EXTERNAL baseline
(`baseline.json`) — never as an edit to the test files.

Each module is launched one of three ways, selectable with `--mode`:

  * script (default): `pyre <path>/test_xxx.py` — runs the test file directly
    as `__main__` so its `if __name__ == "__main__": unittest.main()` block
    fires. Needs only `unittest` plus the module's own imports, making it the
    most robust default. A package, and a file carrying no such block,
    go through a synthesized unittest entry instead — running those directly
    exits 0 without testing anything. Runner metadata gives
    resource-heavy or dotted-identity-sensitive modules the corresponding
    libregrtest bootstrap without changing this default.
  * module: `pyre -m test.<module>` — same unittest entry but via `runpy`
    and the canonical dotted module identity.
  * regrtest: `pyre -m test -v <module>` — CPython's own libregrtest, the
    PyPy/RustPython form. Libregrtest and `test_regrtest` run cleanly.

A (module, backend) result is classified as:

  PASS        rc 0 (unittest printed OK) and at least one test actually ran
  SKIP        the module opted out: it bailed with unittest.SkipTest, was
              denied a resource, or ran nothing but skips
  FAIL        clean nonzero exit (test failures/errors)
  CRASH       rust panic / nonzero internal_compile_panics / signal
  TIMEOUT     exceeded --timeout
  IMPORTERROR module could not even be imported (an interpreter/stdlib gap;
              this is the Phase-0 backlog the suite self-populates)

Gating (default): the run executes only the baseline-PASS subset — the
non-PASS modules carry no gate signal and running the whole suite at the
per-module timeout overruns the CI budget. A module recorded PASS that no
longer passes is a REGRESSION and makes the run exit nonzero. Newly-passing
modules surface only when the non-PASS modules are actually run, so use
`--strict-baseline` (gates on unrecorded improvements), `--full`, or
`--update-baseline` to detect them. `SKIP` baseline entries are not run.

The baseline is a shared file plus a per-host overlay,
`baseline.<sys.platform>-<machine>.json`, consulted first. Whichever host
records a (module, backend) first sets the shared verdict; every other host
writes an entry only where it disagrees, and drops it again once the two
agree. Two separate mechanisms sit next to this: `PLATFORM_GATED` excludes
modules CPython skips wholesale on a host, and `KNOWN_SKIPS` is a decision
about the module rather than the host, so it stays shared.

    `SkipTest` into a skipped test rather than a failure), so the entry claimed
    coverage of a package that ran no test at all.
