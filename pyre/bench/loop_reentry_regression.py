# Regression guard: a compiled hot loop must be re-entered on every call of its
# enclosing function, not only on the call that compiled it.
#
# Wired into check.py via run_selfcheck on dynasm + cranelift; skipped on wasm,
# whose guest has no `time` module. Run it directly:
#
#     python pyre/bench/loop_reentry_regression.py               # PASS (interpreter)
#     target/release/pyre-cranelift pyre/bench/loop_reentry_regression.py
#
# The regression it guards: is_compatible refused re-entry once the enclosing
# module bound a new top-level name and its globals dict grew, so call 1 ran the
# loop compiled (~sub-ns/iter) while calls 2+ ran it interpreted (~1000 ns/iter)
# with a per-iteration compiled-entry abort. The ~1000x margin makes the 20x gate
# below not timing-flaky.
