# Benchmark: integer list setslice (per-strategy ops)
# Exercises W_ListObject slice assignment: lst[a:b] = [...] on Integer strategy.
# PYPYLOG confirms: guard_class(IntegerListStrategy) + new_array(3, ArrayS 8).
# On main, there was no setslice op (Object-only fallback).
# On this branch, setslice stays in Integer strategy when new items are plain ints.
