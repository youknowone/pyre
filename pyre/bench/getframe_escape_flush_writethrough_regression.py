# Self-checking regression guard for the frame-escape flush that resumes past
# the abort (registered via check.py run_selfcheck, NOT the synthetic suite).
# A residual (may-force) callee stores its own frame; the loop body then reads
# the caller's f_back.f_locals and mutates it through the 3.14 FrameLocalsProxy
# write-through. Reading the redirected caller frame forces it mid-expression:
# the escape flush must commit with the operand-stack mirror (the vable shadow's
# stack region is NULL there) and resume forward AT the escaping opcode. The
# legacy replay-from-loop-entry fallback (PYRE_FBW_ABORT_FLUSH=0) drops the
# in-flight FOR_ITER iteration instead, so `total` comes up short -- the JIT-only
# regression this guards.
#
# The write-through is a 3.14 FrameLocalsProxy behaviour PyPy 3.11 lacks (its
# f_locals is a snapshot), so cpython and pypy disagree on the mutated value and
# this cannot be a synthetic bench; the invariant is pyre-internal instead (a
# correct JIT reproduces the no-JIT result) and is asserted here.
