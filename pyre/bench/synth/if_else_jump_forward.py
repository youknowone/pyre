def main():

    # with an unconditional forward jump over the ELSE body (JUMP_FORWARD), so
    # the loop body exercises JUMP_FORWARD on the hot (THEN) path.  The
    # condition is THEN-dominant (true 6/7 of the time) so the compiled trace
    # stabilizes on the THEN arm — which carries the forward jump — while the
    # ELSE arm stays live as an occasional bridge.  Pure integer arithmetic
    # keeps the result identical across CPython, PyPy, and pyre.
