# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=36
# The ceiling is twice the slowest ratio observed (17.8x on the linux runner),
# rounded up; the gate it replaces was fitted to no measurement.
# `__defaults__` replaced part-way through a compiled loop, in the two shapes
# that break differently from a same-length replacement.
#
# `long_tail` swaps in a tuple LONGER than the parameter list.  Binding then has
# to take the tuple's tail (`argument.py:302-315` keeps `defaults_w[i -
# def_first]` for a `def_first = co_argcount - len(defaults_w)` that has gone
# negative), and only the guard-failure resume path recomputes it — the trace
# and the interpreter's flat-call both derive the tail themselves, so setting
# the same tuple before the loop stays correct while swapping it mid-loop did
# not.
#
# `two_ints` swaps in a two-int tuple, which is a `W_SpecialisedTupleObject_ii`.
# Its `value0` is field 0, exactly where `W_TupleObject.wrappeditems` sits, so a
# trace that reads `wrappeditems` off the live `defs_w` without proving the
# class reads the raw integer instead of the items array.
