# A constructor whose `__init__` carries a loop of its own evaluated to
# `None` instead of the instance.
#
# `__init__`'s loop reaches its own back-edge threshold first and compiles, so
# when the enclosing loop traces `C()` the walker's `__init__` sub-walk stops
# at that loop header and reports `SubLoopCalleeCallAssembler`: the callee is
# entered through `CALL_ASSEMBLER` into the token it already has, and the
# fold writes the assembler's result into the CALL's destination.  That result
# is `__init__`'s own return -- `None` -- where the CALL has to evaluate to the
# instance.  The recorded trace then reads `C() is None` off the wrong value,
# and every iteration deopts on the guard that says it was False.
#
# `type_descr_call_impl` is what discards `__init__`'s result and answers
# `w_newobject`, and the fold has no resume coordinate to play that tail at,
# so it residualizes the instantiation instead.
#
# Measured before the fix on dynasm at the DEFAULT thresholds: the `while`
# shapes reported 97 of 300 constructor calls evaluating to `None`, the `for`
# shapes 5 of 20000, and `PYRE_NO_JIT=1` reported none.
