# Implicit `__context__` chaining: raising inside an `except` block links the
# new exception's `__context__` to the one being handled (the raise records
# `SETFIELD w_context = ec.sys_exc_value`). The outer handler reads
# `e.__context__` and checks its type, so a wrong/absent context chain (or a
# context slot that aliased the wrong exception) changes the output.
#   inner raise ValueError -> caught -> raise KeyError (chained)
#   outer catches KeyError, e.__context__ must be the ValueError instance
# Per-iteration contribution is 1 when the chain is correct; a mismatch jumps
# by 1000, so any regression is loud. Deterministic.
