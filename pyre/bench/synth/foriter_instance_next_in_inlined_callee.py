# pyre-check: spec-folds=instance_next
# The `for` loop lives in `step`, which the walker inlines into `run`'s trace,
# so the `ForIterNext` residual it carries is dispatched from an inline
# sub-walk rather than from the walk's own snapshot root.
#
# `instance_next` used to refuse that position outright, and so did
# `walker_foriter_green_key`: the key was derived from `fbw_mode.snapshot_sym`,
# which still names the OUTER portal during a sub-walk, so a callee offset run
# through the caller's pc tables answers with a Python pc belonging to neither
# loop. With the fold refused, `Outer.__next__` stayed an opaque residual and
# ran as a real frame in the plain interpreter: 5.3s here against 1.1s once the
# key is read off the JitCode the walk is actually executing.
#
# No `max-pypy-ratio`: at a size that keeps this fixture's own runtime sane,
# pypy's execution-only time clamps to `EXEC_TIME_FLOOR_S` and check.py skips
# the ratio (`~`) on exactly the runs the ceiling would have to gate. The fold
# census is the instrument that separates the two states here, and it reads the
# same on every host -- `instance_next` fires once with the sub-walk route open
# and not at all with it closed.
#
# `foriter_call_body` covers the same fold from the loop-owning function; only
# the callee position exercises the green key this fixture guards.
