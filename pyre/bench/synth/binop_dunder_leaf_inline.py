# Run 33384229844 reads four loops on windows and three on the other hosts;
# bridges stay at two and all dunder admission/refusal checks are unchanged.
# A `BINARY_OP` / `COMPARE_OP` whose dunder is a call-free Python body.
#
# The walker used to refuse every one of these.  The refusal was not about the
# operand or the class: it was that a `NotImplemented` result has to go back to
# the full binary protocol, and with no rewind at this entry the walk discarded
# it with a bare `Err`, which leaves the driver replaying the loop with the
# body's effects already applied.  So admission asked for a whole-body `Clean`
# verdict -- and `LoadAttr` and `BinaryOp` are both deferred helpers, which
# makes `return self.x + o` `DeferredCall` and refuses the simplest dunder
# there is.  The residual that stood in its place runs a whole interpreter
# frame per iteration.
#
# What the loops below cover is the shape that IS admitted: a body that reaches
# its result without committing anything on the way.  That is not read off the
# code object -- no static scan can separate `return self.v + o.v` over ints
# from one whose `+` dispatches to a mutating dunder -- so the entry refuses
# the first commit, before it runs, and cuts.  `fast` below is the admitted
# side of that: its `+`, `*` and `<` all reduce to integer arithmetic, so
# there is nothing to refuse and the body inlines whole.
# `slow` is the declined side, delegating through a call that can; it must stay
# residual and is here so the two sit side by side, not because it gates.
# `synth/binop_dunder_commit_then_notimplemented` is what gates the refusal.
#
# The ceiling gates admission of `fast`. On this run dynasm reads 1.2x and
# cranelift 2.2x; the ceiling is twice the slower. Losing admission puts
# `fast`'s `+`, `*` and `<` back on a residual frame apiece, and that reading
# stays above the ceiling.
#
# Deterministic, terminating, prints an int checksum; jit == nojit.
