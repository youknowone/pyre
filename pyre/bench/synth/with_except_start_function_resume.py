# A function-entry trace records only the early-return arm.  The first true
# call then fails that guard and blackhole-replays the previously unvisited
# `with` arm.  WITH_EXCEPT_START must read the live handler stack and call
# `__exit__`; a disconnected graph result used to treat the caught TypeError
# as the exit callable and leak another TypeError instead.
