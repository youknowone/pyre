# A nested `for` loop whose inner `break` lands on the secondary edge of its
# guard — reached from `if not cond: break` (a POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE fall-through) or
# from a break-check that is the last statement in the loop body (a
# POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE that jumps forward to the break) — must reconstruct the
# operand stack correctly when the inner iterator is popped and control resumes
# at the outer FOR_ITER. Both the break-check-first and accumulate-first forms,
# plus a compound `and` guard, are exercised. Output is verified against
# CPython/PyPy.
