# pyre-check: spec-folds=builtin_locals
# `locals()` on the PORTAL frame of a loop whose frame is wider than the
# expansion's old ceiling.
#
# `try_walker_specialize_builtin_locals` unrolls `fast2locals`' slot loop one
# guard plus at most one store per bound slot.  Upstream bounds that unroll
# with nothing but `@jit.unroll_safe` on `pyframe.py` `PyFrame.fast2locals`,
# and asks the size question once over the whole history in `pyjitpl.py`
# `MetaInterp.blackhole_if_trace_too_long`; the walker used to carry a second,
# fixed ceiling of 32 slots and ask it per fold instead.
#
# A refusal here answers correctly -- it falls through to the generic
# residual, which computes the same mapping -- so nothing about the ANSWER
# says whether the fold ran.  What it costs is the loop: the residual's
# locals read forces the portal frame, and the walk cannot carry that.
#
# `wide` carries 44 slots, and the loop that reads them is in `wide` itself,
# so this is the portal arm rather than the callee arm
# (`locals_in_wide_inlined_callee` is that one).  Measured on release dynasm:
#
#   with the ceiling      consulted=5 fired=0   loops_compiled=0 loops_aborted=5
#   without it            consulted=3 fired=2   loops_compiled=1 loops_aborted=0
#
# so the ceiling was not costing one residual per iteration, it was costing
# the loop.  Both halves are gated -- `spec-folds` on the fold and
# `selfcheck-compiles` on the loop -- because either alone reads as a pass on
# a run that answered right and compiled nothing.
#
# The mapping is never bound to a local.  Binding it would put the previous
# iteration's mapping in the next one's, chaining N dicts through the frame
# and measuring the collector rather than the fold.
