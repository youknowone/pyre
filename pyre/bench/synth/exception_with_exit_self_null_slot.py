# A `with` block whose handler runs on most iterations of a hot `while` loop.
# LOAD_SPECIAL pushes the resolved `__exit__` and the call's `self_or_null`
# slot; that NULL is a live value, and the dense virtualizable shadow cannot
# tell it from an unwritten slot. Carried as a mirror hole rather than as a
# constant, the slot was omitted from the resume image and a blackhole
# resuming into WITH_EXCEPT_START read the bound `__exit__` the same opcode had
# pushed one slot below, calling it with the receiver twice
# ("__exit__() takes 4 positional arguments but 5 were given").
#
# No FOR_ITER: this is the shape that reaches the defect with no opcode gate
# involved, so it stays a witness independently of what the FOR_ITER body scan
# admits. Kept at module scope, where it was first reproduced.
