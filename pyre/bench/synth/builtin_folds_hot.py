# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=4.4
# Ubuntu run 33279264115: 1.7-2.2x; the ceiling is twice the slowest,
# rounded up to one decimal place.
# pyre-check: skip-cpython
# The ceiling was fitted when the `builtin_fold1` / `builtin_fold2` hand
# folds answered these calls, at 4.6x / 4.7x on darwin-arm64, 7.2x / 7.6x on
# ubuntu-24.04 and 9.2x / 10.0x on windows (half the loop counts below).  The
# loop counts are doubled so pypy's execution-only time clears
# FLOOR_GATE_MIN_BASELINE_S on the windows runner, whose CPU accounting
# advances in 1/64s ticks, and so the fixed startup-subtraction error is a
# smaller share of the denominator.
#
# Every builtin here is now an interp2app gateway the generic builtin descent
# walks, the way the tracer walks straight into an RPython builtin body:
#
#   hash_int           `_hash_int` inline on an exact machine int.
#   hash_str           an exact `str` pinned first, then one
#                      `elidable_cannot_raise` leaf the optimizer hoists out
#                      of the loop.
#   ord_str            the same shape, the leaf returning the code point of a
#                      one-code-point exact `str`.
#   abs_int/abs_float  `descr_abs` on an exact int (short of `i64::MIN`) or
#                      float, boxed by a leaf the optimizer keeps virtual.
#   min_max            two exact machine ints or floats compared inline; the
#                      answer is the winning operand's own reference.
#
# Every other operand shape reaches the original builtin body through a
# `dont_look_inside` slow path.  Without the descent each call is a
# `bh_call_fn(builtin, NULL, ...)` residual: the frame force, the argument
# rooting, the execution-context resolution and the gateway signature binding
# all run before the body does, and the ratio is the detector, because the
# residual compiles the same loop and changes no jit-stats counter.
