# Sequence repeat semantics: a count exceeding the signed machine word overflows
# (OverflowError) rather than wrapping to a huge unsigned count that fails as
# MemoryError, and a count of 1 on an immutable exact sequence returns the
# receiver unchanged while a mutable one copies. Output verified against
# CPython/PyPy.
