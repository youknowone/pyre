# `function.py:673` / `:720` `StaticMethod._immutable_fields_ =
# ['w_function?']` and the `ClassMethod` twin.  The `?` is what lets a tracer
# bake the wrapped callable and equally what registers the invalidation an
# assignment to the slot owes, so re-initialising an installed wrapper revokes
# every loop that folded it.
#
# Re-initialising a wrapper is the case no other pin reaches: it changes no
# type's version tag and leaves the descriptor at the same address, so a fold
# that pinned the DESCRIPTOR still holds while the callable inside it has
# already been replaced.
#
# Each rebind happens INSIDE its loop: a read after the loop is interpreted and
# would not consult what the trace baked.  The wrapped bodies are residual-free
# so the folds stand rather than aborting.
