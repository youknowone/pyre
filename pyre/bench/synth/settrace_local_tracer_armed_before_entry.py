# pyre-check: selfcheck
# pyre-check: selfcheck-interpreted
# Self-checking guard for the other half of the local-tracing contract: a
# global tracer that RETURNS ITSELF, so `_trace` (executioncontext.py) installs
# it as `w_f_trace` on every frame it sees a `call` event for, and the loop
# inside that frame then runs with local tracing already armed.  A global hook
# that returns `None` declines local tracing and only ever fires frame-level
# events, so it cannot observe any of this -- which is why the events below
# were not covered by anything before.
#
# SCOPE -- read this before citing the fixture as a guard for anything.  The
# hook is armed BEFORE the frame is entered, which is what the name says and
# what makes this the plain evaluator's fixture and not the JIT's:
# `eval_with_jit_inner` (`pyre-jit/src/eval.rs`) routes any frame for which
# `frame_tracing_active` holds to `execute_frame_plain`, so the loop here never
# compiles and never reaches the portal.  Measured: it passes identically with
# and without the `debugdata` guard its sibling fixtures were added for, so it
# discriminates nothing about that fix and must not be read as covering it.
# It is written to keep holding when that gate is narrowed -- which is the
# point of having it now rather than then, since a fixture added alongside the
# change that needs it proves nothing about the state before.
#
# In particular it does NOT cover the open GC abort (`GC BUG: invalid type_id
# ... site=marking_regray_root`).  That one needs local tracing armed on a
# frame that is ALREADY compiled: `f_trace` set on the frames up the stack from
# inside an already-hot loop, via a SIGALRM handler, with the tracer returning
# itself.  A tracer returning `None` is clean and so is a global-only one --
# that is the discriminating rung, and none of it is what this file does.
#
# Only the loop is measured.  The frame-entry and frame-exit events are
# deliberately outside the window: pyre instruments the `RESUME` at pc 0 and so
# reports one extra `line` event at the `def` line, with and without the JIT,
# and that belongs to a separate open defect rather than to this one.  What is
# stated here is exact where it counts -- one `line` event on the body
# statement per iteration, no more and no fewer.
