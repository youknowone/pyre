# A user `__getitem__` inlined inside a `for` body, subscripted with an index
# produced on the operand stack rather than read from a local.
#
# The FOR_ITER admission gate must not identify "entered from a CALL" by the
# absence of an `arg_class_guard`: the subscript route also leaves that empty
# even though it enters from `BINARY_OP`, so the inline is accepted wrongly.
# The abort rewind has no CALL coordinate there, so the flush resumed with the
# operand stack one short and the index operand was replaced by an unrelated
# live reference — the iterator, the iterated list, or a bound method.
