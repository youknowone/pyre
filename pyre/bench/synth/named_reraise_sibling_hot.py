# A named `except E as m:` handler whose body bare-re-raises compiles its
# implicit cleanup to `DELETE_FAST m; RERAISE`, immediately followed by a
# sibling `except` clause's type check. On the re-raise path the exception must
# route to the outer re-raise landing and the sibling clause must NOT run; the
# binding `m` is cleared. A `del` of a bound local inside the try body plus a
# sibling clause exercises the same walker-native DELETE_FAST bound
# continuation. Output is verified against CPython/PyPy.
