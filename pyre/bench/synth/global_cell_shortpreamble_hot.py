# A module-global int accumulator carried through an inlined function that
# branches on the loop variable `i`, where the loop body ALSO reads `i` at the
# tail (a branch / dead guard / mid-loop reassignment). The `LOAD_NAME i` folds
# to a getfield of the runtime-minted mutable name cell; the tail read
# re-populates that cache at the end of the preamble, and the short-preamble
# export must NOT hoist it as a loop invariant — the residual STORE_NAME writes
# the cell every iteration, so the peeled body must re-read it live or the
# inlined callee sees the previous iteration's `i` and picks the wrong branch.
# Output is verified against CPython/PyPy.
