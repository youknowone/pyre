# PEP 709 inlines comprehensions into their enclosing scope. At module
# scope the iteration variable becomes a CO_FAST_HIDDEN local, yet a later
# top-level binding of the same name is a normal global (STORE_NAME). The
# fast<->locals sync must skip the hidden slot, otherwise the next global
# store erases the just-bound name and reading it raises NameError.

total = 0                         # a second global store must not erase `n`


def _hot(n, total):
    # The two STORE_NAMEs above are the correctness test. The trip count
    # is only a perf loop: keeping `i`/`total` as module names here is
    # STORE_NAME every iteration and revokes any trace that folded a
    # LOAD_GLOBAL from this module (`celldict.py notify_version_watchers`).
