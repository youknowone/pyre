# A conditional expression selects one of two loop locals as the receiver
# (`q = o if cond else p`) whose attribute is then read/written inside a hot
# `for i in range(...)` loop.  The two arms of the conditional are distinct
# JitCode source blocks reached without a Python CFG edge; replaying the
# previous opcode across that layout switch overwrote the loop-carried
# FOR_ITER iterator with the selected local, so a later guard serialized the
# foreign box into the resume image and the range iterator was lost
# (`TypeError: not an iterator`).  A mid-loop swap of the two locals keeps the
# selection genuinely dynamic.  Deterministic, terminating, int checksum;
# jit == nojit.
