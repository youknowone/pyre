# No `max-pypy-ratio`: this fixture compiles no loop -- its jitstats record
# `loops_compiled=0` -- so a pypy ratio compares two interpreters' startup
# rather than any generated code, and reads whatever the host's process
# spawn cost happens to be that run. The jitstats baselines gate it.
# Regression guard: an INLINED callee that inspects its own frame via
# sys._getframe(0) must still see ITS OWN frame, not its caller's. The walker
# executes residuals concretely while an inline push never runs the
# interpreter's call sequence, so ec.topframeref still names the caller unless
# the inline declines or materialises the callee's frame. Publishing a frame
# for only the inline levels that have one shifts every _getframe up a level
# instead of fixing it, and the shift is invisible to a JIT-vs-JIT comparison
# -- both pyre paths move together. Hence the assert against the literal
# expected chain rather than a self-consistency check.
