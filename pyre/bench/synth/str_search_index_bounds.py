# Every str surface that converts between a code point index and a byte offset:
# find/rfind/index/rindex and count take code point bounds and report a code
# point result, startswith/endswith slice by them, and the width methods read
# the string's own length. Each is folded over payloads whose code points are
# 1-4 bytes wide and over strings long enough to span several index-table
# groups, so an off-by-one in either direction changes the number.
# `warm_find` searches a long wide payload repeatedly: resolving those bounds
# by walking, or by materialising the whole offset table per call, costs orders
# of magnitude rather than staying flat. Output verified against CPython/PyPy.
