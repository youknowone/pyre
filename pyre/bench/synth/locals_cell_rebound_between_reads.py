# pyre-check: spec-folds=builtin_locals
# Three `locals()` calls in ONE loop body, separated by two rebinds of the same
# cell.
#
# The expansion reads a cell slot as `getfield_gc_r(cell, Cell.contents)` -- the
# only place a cell is read as a foldable field rather than through the
# `load_deref` residual.  The write between two of those reads is the
# `store_deref` residual, whose `EffectInfo` is `CannotRaise` with empty
# write-descr sets, so neither the `clean_caches` arm nor `force_from_effectinfo`
# names `Cell.contents`.  Whatever keeps the second read from being folded onto
# the first is therefore not that invalidation, and this fixture is what says so
# out loud: each `locals()` must report the value the cell holds AT that point.
#
# `total` is a sum of differences, so a read folded onto an earlier one drives it
# to zero rather than off by a constant.
