# `IS_OP` records `runtime_ops::is_op` (`ObjSpace.is_w`, then `w_bool_from`).
#
# No `max-pypy-ratio`: this fixture pins the answers, and most of its time is
# the `semantics` half.  `goto_if_not_same_box` carries the perf gate.
#
# A self-compare (`a is a`) answers at `is_w`'s opening `ptr::eq`, and
# `opimpl_ptr_eq` folds `b1 is b2` (`FASTPATHS_SAME_BOXES`, pyjitpl.py), so
# that arm records no compare and no guard.  Distinct boxes record the
# exact-type gates on `w_two` and then the fall-through.  Each never-taken
# arm adds a huge sentinel, so a wrong predicate balloons the checksum.
#
# `semantics` runs the classes whose `is_w` compares by value — int, float,
# complex, tuple, bytes, str, frozenset.  An `int` subclass shares `INT_TYPE`
# with a plain `int` and still answers by pointer identity; the exact-type
# gate in `W_AbstractIntObject.is_w` is what separates them.
