# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=45
# A frame that raises and catches in one body contributes EXACTLY ONE
# traceback node, and it keeps that count once the loop is compiled.
#
# The raise routes through walk()'s SubRaise arm, which scans the raising
# frame for its own `catch_exception/L` and jumps into the handler.  Both the
# `raise/r` arm and that walk-catch arm can record a node for the same frame,
# so the two have to divide the work: the raise arm emits the node the
# compiled trace runs, the walk-catch arm applies the node for the recording
# pass.  Either one taking both halves gives the frame two nodes; either one
# taking neither drops the frame from the chain.
#
# Surveying over N iterations is what catches it — the pre-compile iterations
# are correct, so a single sample sees nothing and a miscount shows up only as
# a SECOND tuple in the shape set.
#
# `reraise` covers the bare-`raise` spelling, which must preserve the node the
# original raise attached rather than adding one of its own, and the callee
# case pins the two-frame chain the same run has to keep producing.
