# A hot module-level `while` loop whose exit deopts into the blackhole, followed
# by observable statements and then a `class` statement.
#
# The blackhole resumes the module frame past the loop guard and executes the
# statements between the loop and the `class` concretely; the `class` statement
# then hits an op it cannot perform and aborts.  When the abort path restored
# the pre-blackhole frame snapshot (locals / valuestackdepth / last_instr) and
# handed control back to the interpreter, the interpreter re-ran the region and
# every effect already performed by the blackhole was applied a second time:
# `print` fired twice, `append` appended twice, `n` counted twice.
#
# Everything here runs at the default thresholds — no `pypyjit.set_param`.
