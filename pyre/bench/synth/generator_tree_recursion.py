# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=7.6
# pyre-check: jitstats-band=guard_failures=8
# Jitcounter decay is 0.96 every 32 minor collections
# (majit-trace/src/counter.rs), so guard_failures tracks collection count during
# each guard's warm-up rather than a compile decision. One host measured
# 3648..3661 across nursery sizes; PYRE_JIT=decay=0 pinned 3600 everywhere,
# while loops_compiled=3 and bridges_compiled=29 stayed invariant and remain
# gated exactly. The fixture sets decay=0 itself, so the band covers the pinned
# run, not that 13-wide unpinned spread; width 8 is margin (0.22%). Real
# regressions this gate caught moved by hundreds to thousands (828 -> 4923,
# 404 -> 812, 937 -> 7408).
# Generator-driven accumulation over recursive tree/linear results. The
# tree_sum recursion once silently miscompiled on cranelift (first checksum
# already wrong) and recovered a regalloc panic on dynasm. Deterministic;
# after k > 7000 the generator switches to a different recursive mix
# (post-warm-up branch divergence).
#
# `decay` (rlib/jit.py:588, default 40) scales every JitCounter entry down, and
# counter.py:104-121 applies that scaling once per 32 minor collections. How far
# a guard's counter has advanced by the time the workload reaches it therefore
# depends on how much the process has allocated so far, which is why the pin
# exists: anything that shifts allocation volume shifts every counter. Both
# dynasm backends now deliver a CALL_ASSEMBLER or nursery result into the
# regalloc result register rather than a JitFrame slot
# (`move_call_assembler_result`, and `consider_call_malloc_nursery`'s
# `force_allocate_reg`), so neither grows the frame per call the way x86 did.
# Left at the default, `guard_failures` reads 3661/3648/3648 across a
# 1MB/4MB/16MB nursery sweep on one binary with `loops_compiled` and
# `bridges_compiled` unchanged; at 0 the same sweep reads one number.
#
# CPython (the oracle) has no `pypyjit`; PyPy and pyre do. Guarding the import
# keeps the output identical across all three while the param only binds where a
# JIT exists. `set_param` rather than an environment variable because the wasm
# guest sees no environment.
