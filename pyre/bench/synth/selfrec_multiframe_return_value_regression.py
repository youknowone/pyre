# pyre-check: selfcheck
# pyre-check: selfcheck-compiles=root:rec,root:step
# A self-recursive callee reached through a multi-frame adopt returned `None`
# from a function whose every path returns an `int` (gh#1444).
#
#     TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'NoneType'
#
# `rec` below returns `1`, `0`, or `rec(...) + 1`.  Never `None`.  The caller
# reported the JIT's answer as a Python-level type error, which is what made
# the shape easy to dismiss as a mistake in the script rather than a wrong
# answer from the compiler.
#
# ## What it was
#
# `PYRE_FBW_MULTIFRAME_DEPTH=1` answered correctly while `=2` and the default
# `7` did not, which put the defect in the depth->=2 multi-frame path rather
# than in any writer of `last_instr`.  The issue title proposes the opposite --
# that a resume restores `last_instr` without its partner `valuestackdepth` --
# and that was implemented and measured: pairing the inline-callee coordinate
# publish with the forward analysis's depth at `callee_py_pc + 1` changed
# nothing here.  `PYRE_FBW_DEBUG_ABORT=1` named one adoption per run:
#
#     [walk-abort] err=LoopBearingCalleeInlineUnsupported { pc: 258,
#                  blackhole_required: true } claimed=true
#     [mf-adopt] frame=0 name="<module>" / 1 "step" / 2,3,4 "rec"
#     [fbw-blackhole] adopted multi-frame terminal depth=5
#
# `MAJIT_LOG=1` showed the terminal is a `DoneWithThisFrameRef`, so neither
# `adopt_blackhole_crn` nor the `BailToInterpreter` arm was the path taken.
#
# ## Why the shape is exactly this
#
# The trigger is narrow, and every widening below was measured to stop
# reproducing, so none of it is decoration:
#
#     rec + id(x)      FAIL      rec + hash(x)   pass
#     rec + id(0)      FAIL      rec + abs(x)    pass
#     rec + repr(x)    FAIL      rec + len([])   pass
#     id(x) in the recursive arm rather than the base case: pass
#     no recursion, same id(x): pass
#
# So the callee has to be SELF-RECURSIVE and its base case has to reach a
# may-force builtin.  BOTH loops are load-bearing -- neither alone reproduces
# at any size -- and so is the plain shape: adding `is None` checks changes
# what compiles, and the instrumented variant passed on binaries the plain one
# failed.  That is why the assertion below sits after both loops and touches
# nothing inside them.
#
# ## What makes this a guard rather than a hope
#
# It fails on the buggy binary.  Two saved pre-fix `pyre-dynasm` binaries both
# die here with the `TypeError` above, while the fixed tree prints the same
# `592304421450` CPython does, on both backends, with
# `PYRE_FBW_MULTIFRAME_DEPTH` 1, 2 and 7 all agreeing.
