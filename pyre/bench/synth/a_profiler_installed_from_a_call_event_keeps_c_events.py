# pyre-check: selfcheck
# A global trace function installs `sys.setprofile()` from the loop frame's own
# `call` event, so the frame is already past every gate that decides how it will
# run by the time it becomes profiled.
#
# `executioncontext.py call_trace` runs the callback first and only then writes
# `getorcreatedebug().is_being_profiled = True`, so the write lands after
# `eval::eval_with_jit_inner` has admitted the frame -- the profiled answer
# cannot come from refusing it.  It comes from the green key instead:
# `is_being_profiled` is an `interp_jit.py` portal green, so a profiled
# activation names a different cell from the one the warm-up loop filled, and a
# trace recorded under that key declines its residual calls
# (`DispatchError::ProfiledResidualCall`) rather than folding them.
#
# THE TAIL IS THE TEST.  A `c_call` count that stops at the entry threshold and
# then holds is what a green key read once, or read before the write, produces;
# the counts below must instead grow by the whole difference between the two
# tails.  Both are exact rather than floors: cpython 3.14.6 and pypy3 agree on
# `c_call` and `c_return` per builtin call at every tail.
