# CHECK_EXC_MATCH against a non-exception target. The loop warms up with a
# valid except class so the trace JIT-compiles, then on the final iteration the
# except target becomes a non-exception (int 5). cmp_exc_match raises TypeError
# when the target is not an exception class / tuple of exception classes; the
# JIT residual path must raise it too (not silently produce a bool and let the
# original exception propagate). The TypeError is caught by an outer handler so
# the output is deterministic. Deterministic.
