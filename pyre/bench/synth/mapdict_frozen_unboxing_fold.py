# `UnboxedPlainAttribute._direct_write` freezes unboxing for the whole class
# after a type change.  Instances created before the freeze retain an unboxed
# slot until `UnboxedPlainAttribute._direct_read` migrates them.  A folded read
# that performs `_prim_direct_read` alone would skip that migration and leave
# unboxed and boxed instances mixed under one promoted-map guard.
# The old throughput ratio required two million live instances merely to lift
# PyPy's nearly empty optimized loops above the timer floor.  CI consequently
# spent most of this fixture first-touching object pages, not exercising the
# migration or folded reread.  Low JIT thresholds plus explicit compilation
# and fold censuses cover those two paths directly with a bounded live set.
