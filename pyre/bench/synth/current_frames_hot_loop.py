# `sys._current_frames()` reached from a hot loop, alongside `sys._getframe()`
# on the same source line.
#
# `_current_frames` (`module/thread/mod.rs`) forces and `mark_as_escaped`s the
# top frame of every thread under a stop-the-world, so it is a second producer
# of the frame-escape shape `sys._getframe` produces on its own
# (`module/sys/vm.rs getframe`).  Nothing in the corpus reached it: the escape
# fixtures all arrive through `_getframe`, `f_back`, or a traceback, leaving
# the whole-thread-roster route uncovered and its abort count ungated.
#
# The discriminator is the SINGLE source line carrying both `f_lineno` reads.
# Both name this frame, so the answers must agree; a values-only check would
# accept a stale line number from either route, because each looks plausible
# on its own.  Identity is asserted first -- the two routes must return the
# same frame object, and a route answering with a copy would still report a
# believable line.
#
# The roster is unpacked rather than indexed by thread id: the wasm guest ships
# no `threading` module, so `get_ident` is unavailable there, and the roster's
# own length is the stronger assertion anyway.
#
# `sys._getframemodulename` belongs to this family and is deliberately NOT
# here: PyPy does not implement it, and a synthetic fixture is also run under
# PyPy for the ratio.  It has its own self-checking fixture,
# `getframemodulename_hot_loop`, which runs on pyre alone.
#
# The shape compiles no loop -- the escape aborts the recording walk each time.
# That is recorded rather than asserted: the jitstats baselines gate
# `loops_aborted`, so a move in either direction becomes a review question
# instead of silent drift.
