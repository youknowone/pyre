# wasm still prints PASS but compiles a root trace after five loop aborts,
# so it cannot declare the native `main` loop.
# The nested `FOR_ITER` operand stack must survive a compiled `_getframe(1)`
# from the inlined callee. The walk answers that call with the portal red
# box and folds `f_lasti` at the CALL, so the loop compiles instead of
# aborting into a multi-frame blackhole.
#
# The walk keeps that virtualizable symbolic, so nothing it pushed or popped
# ever reached the live frame's slot array. When the abort lands on a walk
# that crossed the inner `FOR_ITER`'s exhaust, the outer `FOR_ITER` has
# already run and `GET_ITER` has built a FRESH inner iterator that exists only
# in the walk: resuming without publishing the stack leaves the PREVIOUS
# pass's exhausted iterator on TOS, the inner loop ends one iteration in, and
# every later `i` runs one pass ahead of the `j` beside it. The values the
# body reads stay intact, which is why this reads as a loop-control error and
# not a lost item.
#
# Measured before the stack was published: `k=1041 i=209 j=0`, where `k` says
# the body is at `i=208 j=1` -- the first abort lands at the default hotness
# threshold and every pass after it is shifted. The compiled loop is `main`.
#
# The same read in a `while` loop (`getframe_while_escaping_read_frame_identity`)
# escapes just as often and cannot show this: with no iterator on the operand
# stack there is nothing for a stale image to hold.
