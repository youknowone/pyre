# Depth > 1 kept-stack branch guards: chained comparisons, nested
# short-circuits and conditional expressions keep two or more operand-stack
# temps live across a `goto_if_not`.  The not-taken arm resumes at a merge
# point the full-body walk has not written; the kept temps are recovered
# from the not-taken edge's `ref_copy` parallel-move trampoline (the depth-1
# positional heuristic does not generalize to depth > 1).
#
# Each shape lives in its own minimal loop so the kept-stack guard is the
# whole trace and a miscompile is not diluted by a multi-shape loop.  Pure
# arithmetic -> deterministic checksum.  Regression guard for the depth > 1
# decline removal (`0 < a < b < 9` previously miscompiled 749949 vs 375000,
# `total + (a + ((i & 1) or 5))` 1837502750500 vs 1275003750000).
