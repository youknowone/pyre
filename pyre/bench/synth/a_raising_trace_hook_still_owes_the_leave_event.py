# A profiler and a trace function are both installed on a loop the JIT already
# compiled, and the trace callback raises.
#
# `pyframe.py execute_frame` is two nested `try`s under one `finally`:
# `call_trace` sits in the outer `try`, `return_trace` in the inner `finally`,
# and `ec.leave` -- whose profile arm is the `_trace(frame, 'leaveframe', ...)`
# that becomes `setprofile`'s `return` event -- in the outer `finally`.  So a
# `call_trace` that raises skips both the eval body and `return_trace` and STILL
# owes the leave event, and a `return_trace` that raises owes it too.
#
# pyre's portal carries that bracket itself rather than reaching `execute_frame`
# (`eval::eval_with_jit_inner`), so the nesting has to be carried with it: an
# early return on either of the first two hooks drops the third.  Measured
# before the fix, with the same two arms below: `call` reported no profile event
# at all and `return` reported only `call`.
#
# Both arms are exact and both are checked, because they fail separately -- the
# first drops the leave event from a path that never ran the body, the second
# from a path that did.
#
# The ARGUMENT is checked too, and it is a second defect: `w_exitvalue` is
# `execute_frame`'s own local, so it holds whatever the body returned and keeps
# holding it across a `return_trace` that raises.  Reading it back off the
# bracket's result word instead hands the leave hook `None`, which is what the
# failure -- not the body -- produced.  cpython 3.14.6 and pypy3 disagree here
# and pypy3 is the reference: on the `return` arm it reports the loop's value,
# cpython reports None.
