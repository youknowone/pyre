# `c_call` carries the frame that made the call, and for a builtin called from
# inside a Python callee that is the CALLEE's frame -- never the caller whose
# compiled trace would have inlined it.
#
# The hazard is real and structural: a walker-inlined callee has no frame on
# `topframeref`/`f_backref` while compiled code runs, and
# `call_jit.rs residual_call_c_profile_frame` reads exactly that chain.  A
# builtin residual firing inside an inlined callee would therefore report the
# inliner's frame.  Two independent guards make the conjunction unreachable,
# and this fixture pins both:
#
#   * At RECORD time `inline_call.rs` declines on `ec_hook_installed()` for any
#     installed hook, so a trace recorded under a profiler inlines nothing and
#     the callee gets a real frame.  `armed_before` is that arm.
#   * At EXECUTE time `is_being_profiled` is an `interp_jit.py` portal green, so
#     a profiled frame cannot enter a trace compiled under the unprofiled key;
#     and a frame that entered before the hook was armed keeps
#     `is_being_profiled` false, so the residual's own third test declines --
#     which is what `call_valuestack` does upstream, gating on the same
#     per-frame flag.  `armed_mid_loop` is that arm: it compiles `outer` with
#     `inner` inlined and only then arms the profiler, from inside `inner`.
#
# A relaxation of the inline decline breaks the first guard, and this fixture is
# what says so.  Measured on cpython 3.14.6 and pypy3, which agree on every
# line below.
