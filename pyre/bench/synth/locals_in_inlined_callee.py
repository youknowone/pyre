# pyre-check: spec-folds=builtin_locals
# `locals()` called from a function the tracer inlines must report the CALLEE's
# own fastlocals, not the caller's.
#
# `builtin_locals` reaches its frame through `gettopframe_nohidden`
# (`interp_inspect.py:7-11`), and the walker can fold that whole read into
# direct virtualizable reads instead of a residual call.  Inside an inlined
# callee the walker emits those reads against the CALLEE's own virtualizable --
# its inline body carries `getarrayitem_vable_r` / `setarrayitem_vable_r` for
# the callee's slots -- so the fold answers for the right frame.  Nothing
# pinned that before this fixture: the three existing `locals()` fixtures
# (`locals_forced_frame`, `getframe_caller_locals_after_resume`,
# `recursive_forced_frame_kept_stack`) all call it in the portal frame's own
# loop, where the caller's answer and the callee's answer coincide, so the fold
# never fires in a callee there and a fold-on/fold-off comparison over them
# records absent coverage rather than agreement.
#
# The discriminator is the NAME SET, not the values.  A fold that answered from
# the caller's frame would hand back the loop's own names (`i`, `last`,
# `outer`) instead of the callee's (`x`, `y`), and each value would still look
# plausible, so an assertion on values alone can miss it.
#
# Three shapes, because the walker treats them differently:
#
# * `probe_direct` -- one call deep.  All three builtins that share the fold
#   are exercised: `locals()` and `vars()` land on its mapping arm, `dir()` on
#   its sorted-names arm.
# * `probe_nested` -- two calls deep, which is the shape whose inline entries
#   the walker reports as a sub-walk rather than a plain inline body.
# * `probe_closure` -- a callee holding a freevar.  The freevar's name is part
#   of the expected set, which is what catches a fold that dropped it.
# * `probe_cell_rebound` -- the same freevar shape, but with the cell REBOUND
#   between reads.  `Cell.contents` is mutable and STORE_DEREF is lowered as
#   `PlainCannotRaise`, whose write-descr sets are analyzer-empty, so nothing
#   tells `OptHeap` that a store invalidates the cell read the expansion emits.
#   A merged read would report the value the recording iteration saw rather
#   than the one just assigned.  Two sites: one store per iteration (the hazard
#   is across the back edge) and a second store mid-iteration (the hazard is
#   inside one trace body).  The wrong answer is a plausible integer, so this
#   counts disagreements against a known sequence rather than printing values.
