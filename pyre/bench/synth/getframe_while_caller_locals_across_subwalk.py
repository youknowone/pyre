# No `max-pypy-ratio`: the only loop here is the two-statement `while` driver,
# so a pypy ratio compares two interpreters' startup rather than any generated
# code, and reads whatever the host's process spawn cost happens to be that
# run. The jitstats baselines gate it.
# Caller locals that are live ACROSS the inlined call, read from
# `_gf(1).f_lasti` inside the callee.  That call now lands on the portal red
# box and folds the CALL coordinate, so the loop compiles without a
# virtualizable force.  `acc` and `tag` are carried across every iteration; a
# compile that dropped or restored the wrong slot would change the printed
# totals.
