# pyre-check: spec-folds=subscr
# Hot-loop `s[i]` on an exact `str`. The subscript reaches the walker as the
# `BinaryOp` helper's `Subscr` tag; an exact `str` receiver with an exact
# `int` index descends `baseobjspace::getitem_str` (`descr_getitem`'s scalar
# arm) instead of the generic `CallMayForce`, which forces virtualizables and
# clears the heap cache across itself.
#
# NO throughput ceiling, deliberately. The remaining cost is the boxed code
# point itself, which this loop discards immediately and pypy never
# allocates at all -- `len(s[0])` and `ord(s[0])` cost the same, i.e. the
# cost does not depend on the consumer. Virtualizing that allocation is a
# different lever, so no ratio here would be a stable gate. The `spec-folds`
# line above is the gate; a ratio would only measure the allocation.
#
# The other legs are correctness legs for the shapes the descent must REFUSE,
# each written so a wrongly-admitted shape is a wrong value and not a silent
# pass:
#
#   * a `str` SUBCLASS may override `__getitem__`, which `baseobjspace::getitem`
#     honours; admitting one through the payload `ob_type` it shares would drop
#     the prefix its override adds.
#   * a NON-ASCII receiver indexes code points, not bytes; a fixed-stride read
#     would return a fragment of a multi-byte sequence.
#   * a NEGATIVE index counts from the end, and an out-of-range one raises
#     `IndexError`; the descended body keeps its own length test, so the
#     trace must guard it rather than bake this receiver's length in.
#   * an index past `usize::MAX` is out of range on the 32-bit wasm guest for
#     a reason the other backends never see: the machine int is 64-bit
#     everywhere, so `2**32` must still raise rather than wrap to `0`.
#   * a `bool` index shares `int`'s `intval` but carries its own type, and a
#     `__index__` object is not an int at all.
