# A traceback node must expose the catching frame's live locals while its
# exception handler is still running, including the exception target `e`.
#
# This used to be parked with a wasm exemption.  Once `drive` and `locs` ran as
# compiled portal callees, wasm intermittently read the outermost traceback
# frame as if the implicit handler-exit `del e` had already run.  The resulting
# set contained both the live shape and a stale shape without `e`:
#
#     ("drive", ("e", "k", "seen"))
#     ("drive", ("k", "seen"))
#
# The same fixture also covers the GC-root walk that motivated it originally:
# reading `f_locals` through the traceback can leave a virtual ref in the
# frame's value area while a nursery allocation from compiled code triggers a
# collection.  `walk_frame_value_slot` must forward that virtual ref before
# the raw exception-root walk interprets the slot as a PyObject.
#
# PyPy's `MIFrame` and blackhole resume machinery keep one red frame per
# inlined call.  Keeping `drive`, `locs`, and `mid` attached to their own live
# frames is therefore load-bearing here: the traceback frame's locals cannot
# be recovered from one portal-wide anchor.  The compile declarations pin all
# five trace shapes observed on dynasm, cranelift, and wasm, so an interpreted
# fallback cannot make this test pass vacuously.
