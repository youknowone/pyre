# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=12
# pypy's exec time here sits at the startup-subtraction floor, so the printed
# ratio is not a measurement; the ceiling is fitted to the slowest of nine
# local readings across the three backends plus headroom.
#
# Folding `frame.f_locals` mirrors the virtualizable shadow into the live
# `locals_cells_stack_w` array, because pyre answers the attribute with a 3.14
# `FrameLocalsProxy` that reads that array lazily rather than copying out of it
# at the call. The mirror is an eager walk-time write, so it needs an undo for
# the walk that does not commit — and the undo it is recorded in decides how
# long it survives.
#
# Recording it in the residual force's escape-flush capture is wrong: the tail
# of `try_execute_residual_call_via_executor` restores that capture after EVERY
# non-forcing residual call, so the next call in the same walk reverts the
# mirror and the proxy answers from before the fold. That is what this fixture
# reads — `str(i)` between the fold and the subscript — and the failure is one
# wrong answer on the trace-recording iteration alone, not every iteration, so
# a short loop passes either way.
