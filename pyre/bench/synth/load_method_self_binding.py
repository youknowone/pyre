# pyre-check: trace-shape=entry-bridge:helper:max=GetfieldGcR:2
# LOAD_METHOD's fast-method path decides the descriptor and the receiver
# together (`callmethod.py LOAD_METHOD` pushes `w_descr` then `w_obj`).  pyre
# reaches the two halves through separate jitcode residuals -- `load_attr_fn`
# and `load_method_self_fn` -- and the walker folds them independently, so the
# two verdicts can disagree: the descriptor half bakes the function as a
# constant while the receiver half answers PY_NULL, and the CALL then runs one
# argument short.
#
# `receiver_from_fresh_class` is the witness: the method call sits in a callee
# frame whose receiver is a parameter, and the class is rebuilt every
# iteration, so the callee is first traced on its own (not inlined) long after
# the caller loop compiled.  That standalone trace is where the two folds were
# reached in the order that made them disagree.  A static class, or the same
# call at module level, does not reproduce it.
#
# The remaining legs pin the shapes the receiver half must keep answering
# correctly around that fix: a name shadowed by an instance attribute (no
# binding), a bound method reached through `getattr` (no binding), and a
# classmethod (binds the class, not the instance).
