# No `max-pypy-ratio`: this fixture compiles no loop -- its jitstats record
# `loops_compiled=0` -- so a pypy ratio compares two interpreters' startup
# rather than any generated code. The jitstats baselines gate it.
# Regression guard: `f(*gen())` runs `unpack_into` (baseobjspace.py
# `unpackiterable` generator fast path), which resumes the suspended frame
# once per yield inside one root bracket and reads its results back from a
# base slot. `_invoke_execute_frame` must not leave its own pins on that
# bracket: with them the read-back interleaves the generator and the resume
# value with the yielded values.
