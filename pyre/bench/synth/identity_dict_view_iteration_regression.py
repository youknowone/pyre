# The wasm guest has no `time` module, which the ratio below is built on.
# Self-checking regression guard for the cost of walking an IDENTITY dict's view.
#
# The correctness half is still covered on wasm by
# `module_dict_view_iteration_regression.py`, which walks the same view
# machinery without a clock.
#
# Same trait-default trap as `module_dict_view_iteration_regression.py`, in the
# other strategy that never overrode it.  The dict-view iterator keeps an integer
# cursor and asks the strategy for the `index`-th entry per step
# (`DictStrategy::nth_item`); the default answers by materialising the whole
# `items()` and taking `.nth(index)`.  `IdentityDictStrategy` -- what a dict
# switches to when its keys compare by identity, i.e. any ordinary instance
# (`identitydict.py:12-83`, selected at `dictmultiobject.py:725-730`) -- had no
# override, so one walk of an `n`-entry dict built and threw away `n` vectors of
# `n` pairs.
#
# Unlike the module-dict case those vectors are ordinary Rust heap, so the defect
# shows as time, not as retained RSS.  Measured before the override, walking a
# freshly built dict of 2000 entries: str keys 1.0x, int 1.3x, bytes 2.0x,
# `__hash__`-defining instances 1.0x, tuples 1.0x -- and identity keys 55.2x.
# The ratio grows with n (140x at n = 4000), which is the quadratic term.
#
# The gate is that ratio rather than a wall-clock budget, so it is stable across
# machines and load: both walks are the same loop over the same number of
# entries, and after the fix both are O(1) per step.
#
# ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING.  The first `len()`, `bool()` or `list()` on an identity
# dict promotes it to `ObjectDictStrategy`, which always had the override -- so
# every later walk is fast whatever this strategy does.  The promotion is O(n)
# and visible: on a 2000-entry dict the first `len()` costs 0.000288s and every
# one after 0.000002s, against 0.000002s for the first `len()` of a str-keyed
# dict.  A fixture that checks correctness before timing therefore measures the
# object strategy and passes on the defect.  The timing runs on a pristine dict;
# the correctness checks get their own.  A plain walk and `d[k]` do not promote.
