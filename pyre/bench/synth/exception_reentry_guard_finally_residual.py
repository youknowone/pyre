# A frame whose residual call raises must still run its own `finally`, and must
# contribute exactly one traceback node.
#
# `run` is the `_contextvars_app.py` `Context.run` shape: a re-entry guard ahead
# of a `try`, two non-idempotent stores inside it, and a `CALL_FUNCTION_EX` on an
# arbitrary callable as the protected region's only statement.  The callee forces
# the caller's frame (`sys._getframe(1).f_locals`), so the call escapes the
# virtualizable mid-opcode and the walk ends on that escape.
#
# Three separate ways to get this wrong, each visible in the output:
#   - the escape falls back to a legacy replay of the already-executed prefix, so
#     the guard sees its own store and raises `RuntimeError` (`reentry`);
#   - the walk's terminal raise skips the frame's exception table, so `finally`
#     never restores the two stores (`leaked`);
#   - the frame leaves without recording its traceback node (`shapes`).
#
# The `except` calls `names()`, which bears a loop, so the callee inline is
# unsupported and the abort has to be adopted rather than retraced.
