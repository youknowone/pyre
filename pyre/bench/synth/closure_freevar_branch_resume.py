# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=28
# gh#498 guard: a branch resume must keep the current closure-call result
# local, across the three freevar flavours.
#
#   readonly   — the closure only reads a freevar;
#   list_cell  — it appends to a list held in a cell;
#   nonlocal   — it rebinds the freevar itself.
#
# Each flavour keeps its own driver loop so the closure stays a direct call
# from the hot loop, as it was when these lived in separate files.
