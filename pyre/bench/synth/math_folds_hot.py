# This fixture carried a wasm allowance of 13, fitted to a darwin-arm64
# reading of 8.1-9.0x.  Most of that was the host crossing: `isclose`, `frexp`
# and `ldexp` lower to helpers with mixed `f64`/word signatures, which the
# backend would not lower in-module without a caller vouching for them, so
# 3,998,958 calls left the trace module.  Vouched, the fixture reads 1.5x on
# the same host and carries no allowance.
# What remains of the gap is structural rather than a regression: `pymath`
# reaches the platform libm on native and its pure-Rust `libm` fallback in the
# guest, and the guest also pays an errno-classifying wrapper the native build
# folds away.  Measured on the same fold machinery and the same loop, wasm
# runs 2M folded `log` (which lowers to `x.ln()`) in 0.09s and 2M folded `exp`
# (which goes through `pymath`) in 0.24s.  Both backends fold; only the
# operation underneath differs.
# The ratio is the detector here: losing a fold changes no jit-stats counter,
# because the residual it falls back to compiles the same loop.  Measured on
# an idle darwin-arm64 box against pypy 0.33s — every fold 0.63s, the generic
# float/isclose folds suppressed 2.71s, all folds suppressed 33.4s.  The gate
# sits between the first two.
# Every `math` primitive the walker folds, one hot loop per fold shape.  A
# residual `bh_call_fn(builtin, NULL, x)` costs an argument tuple, a
# `W_FloatObject` allocation and a full builtin dispatch per iteration; each
# specialization instead unboxes the operands, emits the raw operation, and
# leaves the result box virtualizable.
#
#   sqrt         `try_walker_specialize_math_sqrt` — `x >= 0` and `isfinite(x)`
#                pin the two `ll_math_sqrt` branches, then a pure
#                `CALL_F(sqrt_nonneg_jit)` with no result guard.
#   log/cos/sin  `try_walker_specialize_math_log_trig` — same shape, one
#                domain guard each.
#   fabs         `try_walker_specialize_math_fabs` — a single `FloatAbs`;
#                `fabs` raises for no input, so it carries no domain guard.
#   floor/ceil/  `try_walker_specialize_math_round_to_int` — guard the operand
#   trunc        into the signed machine range, round, `CastFloatToInt`.
#   isclose      `try_walker_specialize_math_isclose` — one pure `CALL_I`
#                into a total helper, whose truth the branch's own guard
#                already pins, so it carries no result guard.
#   the rest     `try_walker_specialize_math_float{1,2}` — one pure elidable
#                `CALL_F` into the function's raw helper plus a finite-result
#                guard.  The helper reports every raising direction as NaN, so
#                the guard alone carries the domain: `exp` overflowing,
#                `atanh` outside (-1, 1) and `pow(0.0, -2.0)` all resume in
#                the builtin and raise there.
#
# A rebound callable, a numeric subclass, or an operand outside the folded
# domain keeps the residual in every case.
#
# Every loop below derives its operand from the counter, so what the ratio
# reads is the per-iteration cost of a fold and not what the optimizer can do
# with one.  Recording these calls as elidable lets the pure pass serve a
# second identical call from the first, which pays only where the operand does
# not change.  Measured on darwin-arm64 against the previous binary,
# interleaved over seven rounds, an invariant operand reads 6.2x on
# `pow`/`atan2`, 3.5x on `tan`/`exp`, 3.3x on `log`/`cos`/`sin`, 2.1x on
# `frexp`, 1.9x on `ldexp`, 1.4x on `floor`/`ceil`, 1.2x on `isqrt` and 1.05x
# on `sqrt` -- each ahead in 7 of 7 rounds -- while the shapes below stay
# within noise of where they were, their peeled bodies unchanged op for op.
# `isclose` is the one fold that does not move even on an invariant operand:
# its answer is consumed entirely by the branch's own guard and never reaches
# the `Jump`, so nothing pulls the cached value across the loop boundary.
