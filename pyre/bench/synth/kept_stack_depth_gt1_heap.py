# Depth > 1 kept-stack branch guards whose kept / merge slot is a HEAP int
# (>= 256, a LOAD_CONST rather than the inline LoadSmallInt).  Sibling of
# `kept_stack_depth_gt1.py`, which keeps only small-int slots (11, 5, 2); here
# every short-circuit merges a heap-magnitude constant so the not-taken arm
# resumes with a hoisted (loop-invariant) heap-int box in a kept operand-stack
# slot.
#
# The short-circuit result flows into a wider expression (`total + (a + ...)`),
# so the merge slot lives at operand-stack depth > 1 across the `goto_if_not`.
# The heap constant is loop-invariant, so it is hoisted once; a merge-slot
# recovery that reads a stale / color-reused box for the hoisted heap-int
# delivers a WRONG value on the merge arm (the census-caught heap-int
# short-circuit miscompile that the small-int siblings do not exercise).
#
# This is also the resume shape most sensitive to the branch-guard resume
# coordinate: under a direct-jitcode-pc resume the not-taken arm is rebuilt at
# the guard pc, so the hoisted heap-int kept slot must be sourced faithfully
# there.  Byte-exact against the interpreter oracle pins that reconstruction.
#
# Asymmetric per-shape weighting makes any transposition or staleness change the
# checksum.  Pure arithmetic -> deterministic checksum across runtimes.
