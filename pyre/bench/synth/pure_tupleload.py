# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=14
# pypy's execution-only time here lands between EXEC_TIME_FLOOR_S and
# FLOOR_GATE_MIN_BASELINE_S on nearly every run, the band check.py marks `?`:
# the ceiling is applied while the floor gate declines the same denominator as
# too small to judge, and a denominator that size carries its own magnitude as
# error.  Over the 38 CI jobs of 2026-09-03 unchanged code read 1.6x-9.5x
# across the three hosts and both native backends, crossing the old ceiling of
# 6 seven times.  14 clears the widest by 47%.
# The ceiling sits between the two measured states: served this runs 2.6x pypy,
# and with the arity-2 reader off the loop pays the opaque residual (about 198x
# when the retired `subscr_specialised_pair` fold was the only reader).
# #171/#11 Approach C, SUBSCRIPT slice: canonical-tuple `t[i]` emits a PURE
# getarrayitem in the JIT walker (OptPure CSEs / const-folds the element load).
#
# Case A exercises the canonical array-backed `W_TupleObject` (arity > 2) on the
# hot path — the pure element load is the point of this slice.
#
# Case B reads a 2-element literal tuple in a loop. A 2-int literal tuple may be
# stored as SPECIALISED_TUPLE_II (inline value0/value1, NO wrappeditems block);
# the trace-time `ob_type == &TUPLE_TYPE` gate declines it to the non-pure /
# residual path. It MUST NOT SIGSEGV and MUST stay correct.
#
# Case C builds a fresh arity-2 pair per iteration and reads both halves. This
# is the shape `subscr_tuple_descent` serves by descending `w_tuple_getitem`;
# the hand-written `subscr_specialised_pair` reader it replaced measured 46.3x
# here when suppressed, the largest single-fold effect in the corpus, so this
# loop is what keeps the ceiling below honest.
