# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=25
# An exception escaping a compiled frame must keep a traceback node for every
# INLINED intermediate frame it passed through.
#
# `driver`'s loop compiles with `mid_pass` inlined into the trace and `leaf`
# residual.  When `leaf` raises, the exception surfaces at the trace's
# GuardNoException and the blackhole chain - two frames, `mid_pass` then
# `driver` - is walked looking for a handler.  That walk recorded a node only at
# the bottommost frame, so `mid_pass` was propagated over silently and vanished
# from the traceback: it has no interpreter frame of its own, the trace is its
# whole presence.
#
#   before: ('<module>', 'driver', 'leaf')
#   after:  ('<module>', 'driver', 'mid_pass', 'leaf')
#
# Expected output, one line per middle function:
#   mid_pass    ('<module>', 'driver', 'mid_pass', 'leaf')
#   mid_outer   ('<module>', 'driver', 'mid_outer', 'mid_pass', 'leaf')
#   mid_reraise ('<module>', 'driver', 'mid_reraise', 'leaf')
#
# Discriminators, each verified against pypy3 and PYRE_JIT=0:
#   * the walk-time path was already correct - catching the same exception
#     inside the hot loop keeps every level, because a different arm records it;
#   * giving the middle function any try block, matching or not, or a bare
#     `finally`, hid the loss: the inline declines on the try-block marker, so
#     the frame becomes residual and the interpreter records it;
#   * three call levels hid it for the same reason;
#   * the middle frame had to be INLINED - a residual one was never affected.
#
# The deeper shapes below guard the other direction: the walk now records at
# every frame it propagates over, so a level that already had a node from
# somewhere else would show up twice.  Each line is a full chain, so a doubled
# node is as visible as a missing one.
