# A module-scope LOAD_NAME whose name misses the module dict resolves through
# the frame's builtin module.  The builtins cell folds under the module dict's
# version? (so a later global binding shadows the builtin) and the builtins
# dict's own version?.  The second loop proves that invalidation is seen: the
# census reads `builtin_len_descent` consulted twice and fired once, the decline being
# the shadowed call.
