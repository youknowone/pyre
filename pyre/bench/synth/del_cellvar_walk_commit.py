# `del <cellvar>` lowers to `load_deref_value` (the bound check) plus
# `store_deref_value(cell, NULL)`, where the NULL is the clear-the-cell
# sentinel `bh_store_deref_value_fn` hands straight to `w_cell_set` without
# ever reading it.
#
# The walker's NULL-Ref-arg refusal used to decline that residual, which marks
# the walk as carrying a recorded-but-unexecuted effect.  Every walk over this
# loop then failed the walk-end flush ("unjournaled effect — legacy replay
# kept") and handed the region back to a replay that re-ran the residuals the
# walk had already executed concretely.  `bump` is one of them, so `log` grew
# by exactly one entry per walk: 20048 instead of 20000, on both backends and
# at stock thresholds.
#
# `grab` is what makes the cell a real closure cell rather than a plain local.
