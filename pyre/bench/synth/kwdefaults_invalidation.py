# pyre-check: selfcheck
# pyre-check: selfcheck-compiles=argument_shapes,hot,missing_window
# pyre-check: spec-folds=kwonly_defaults_inline
# Self-checking guard for the pins under an inlined callee's keyword-only
# defaults.
#
# Seeding those locals no longer probes `__kwdefaults__` per call.  The mapping
# a definition builds carries a version, so the walker bakes each entry's cell,
# pins `Function.w_kw_defs` with a `GuardValue`, records a quasi-immutable
# marker on the mapping's strategy version, drains that marker with a
# `GuardNotInvalidated`, and reads the cell's field live.  Three separate
# mechanisms therefore stand between a mutation and the next call, and a census
# can only say the fold fired -- not that the pins are honest.  Each site below
# moves one of them and prints a wrong number if that one is missing.
#
# Sites:
#   A  overwrite an existing entry in place.  A cell that already holds an
#      object absorbs the store and bumps no version, so nothing invalidates:
#      this is answered by the live field read alone, and a fold that baked the
#      VALUE rather than the cell keeps returning the old one.
#   B  delete an entry, then add it back.  Both move the strategy version, and
#      the deleted window is observable on its own -- the call must raise
#      rather than seed a stale default.
#   C  rebind the attribute.  `f.__kwdefaults__ = d` stores `d` itself, so only
#      the `Function.w_kw_defs` guard can catch this; the version marker is
#      still watching the old mapping, which no longer answers anything.
#   D  keep calling after that rebind.  A plain dict has no version to pin, so
#      the resolve declines and the callee seeds through the ordinary path --
#      which must still see a later in-place mutation.
