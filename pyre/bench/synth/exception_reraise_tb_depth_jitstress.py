# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=15
# Locals for except-as stop the module-dict `version?` revoke storm
# (`celldict.py notify_version_watchers`), so pypy compiles the
# driving loops. `run()`'s `for` re-raises through `except E as e`,
# and its handler entry reads `last_exc_value`
# (`pyjitpl.py opimpl_last_exc_value`). The bridge seeds that slot
# from the frame (`seed_standing_exception_for_walk`), so
# `can_enter_jit` (`interp_jit.py`) traces the `for` and the
# traceback `while` on their own back-edges. A late `abort_permanent`
# resumes at the opcode that emitted it
# (`abort_permanent_py_pc_by_jit_pc`), not at the floor segment's
# trailing `RERAISE`, so the live frame is not left on `END_FOR`.
# The ceiling stays 15.
# JIT-stress twin of exception_reraise_tb_depth_hot: `pypyjit.set_param`
# lowers the trace/function thresholds to 1 so trace recording fires on the
# earliest iterations rather than only after the ~1600-iteration warmup. That
# makes the recording pass land on the re-raise sections on every run and every
# backend (the param hook reaches the wasm guest, which sees no environment),
# turning the historically platform-dependent recording-path coverage into a
# deterministic check.
#
# Traceback shape invariants (identical to the non-stress twin): a same-frame
# bare re-raise keeps the original traceback (depth 2, no node at the re-raise
# coordinate), a named re-raise `raise e` attaches its node (depth 3), and a
# `finally` passthrough attaches nothing (depth 2).
# CPython (the oracle) has no `pypyjit`; PyPy and pyre do. Guarding the import
# keeps the output identical across all three while the thresholds only bind
# where a JIT exists.
