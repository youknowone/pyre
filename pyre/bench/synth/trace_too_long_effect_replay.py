# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=18
# A trace that outgrows `trace_limit` must not re-apply effects the walk has
# already executed. The walker's length check fires at an arbitrary opcode,
# unlike every other abort, which declines before executing an effect it
# cannot roll back; an abort resumes by re-interpreting the iteration from the
# trace entry, so an executed-but-unrollbackable effect would land twice.
#
# `pypyjit.set_param` lowers `trace_limit` far enough that the check binds on
# every backend (the param hook reaches the wasm guest, which sees no
# environment). CPython, the oracle, has no `pypyjit`; guarding the import
# keeps the output identical across all three while the limit only binds where
# a JIT exists.
