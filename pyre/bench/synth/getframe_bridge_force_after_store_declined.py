# Historical `_declined` companion to `getframe_bridge_force_after_store`.
# The name predates the standard-frame `f_locals` specialization: an exact
# `_getframe(0)` result now creates its CPython 3.14 `FrameLocalsProxy` without
# residualizing the getter or forcing the portal virtualizable.
#
# That is also what the PyPy oracle does through its `@jit.unroll_safe`
# `fast2locals`: one loop, one bridge, no forcings, no virtualizable forcings,
# and no aborts.  The rare bridge and the preceding effectful `box.n = i`
# remain useful coverage that the optimized frame read neither duplicates nor
# loses the store.
