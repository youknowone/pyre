# gh#495 guard: fbw_abort_nested_unjournaled_residual prevents the ForIterNext exemption double-advance.
# branch-bearing callee with a SECOND FOR_ITER (nested), not the loop header.
# Two shared generators; inner FOR_ITER advance is a non-header foriter (Finding #2).
# Post-inner declining residual forces abort while inner item in-flight.
# N is large enough that pypy's user time clears startup noise (~0.24s).
# A single-yield generator is inlined at FOR_ITER: `dispatch`'s `except Yield`
# `popvalue` (`generator_resume_yield`) returns the suspended value.
# `MAJIT_STATS` on this loop records `caro_no_merge_entry=0` and one compiled
# trace (`loops_compiled=1`), so gouter/ginner are not left interpreted.
# The 20x ceiling is that compiled loop.
