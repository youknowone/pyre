# Multi-except dispatch + counter-only handler bodies on the blackhole
# guard-failure resume path. The loop warms up exception-free (so the trace
# compiles the no-exception path), then raises ZeroDivisionError and
# IndexError after warm-up. Each `except` body only bumps a counter and the
# `try` result is dead — the shape that exposed two resume bugs:
#   - every exception matched the FIRST `except` unconditionally (the type
#     dispatch fell through to a blanket match), so the second clause was
#     never reached, and
#   - a single matched exception ESCAPED because the CHECK_EXC_MATCH bool
#     was pinned to a scratch register the following truth test never read,
#     so the handler was skipped.
# A trace that raises from iteration 1 records the handler and never needs
# the resume path; only warm-up-then-raise reaches it.
