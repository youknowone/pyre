# An exception raised by a CALLEE (a helper function or an exhausted generator)
# with a per-iteration computed argument, caught in a hot JIT-traced caller's
# `except ... as e`. walker_record_guard_exception discarded the GuardException
# result box and left last_exc_value as the recording-time const_ref, so once the
# loop compiled, e.args[0] / e.value read back the value frozen at trace-record
# time instead of the live raised instance. A same-frame raise never showed this
# because its raised value stays live. Deterministic, terminating, int checksum;
# jit == nojit once the guard result box carries the live exception.
