# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=40
# `_abc_instancecheck` answers from two per-class weak-set caches, and a
# question that hits one is meant to cost the probe and nothing else.  This
# drives both answers in a hot loop: a class that matches (positive cache) and
# one that never will (negative cache), plus the stdlib `collections.abc`
# checks, whose caches are shared with everything else that asks them.
#
# A `register` partway through discards every negative cache by bumping the
# invalidation counter, so the second half re-walks and refills rather than
# reading the entries the first half recorded.  Deterministic.
