# pyre-check: selfcheck

# pyre-check: spec-folds=builtin_locals
# A key written through `frame.f_locals` that names no writable fast local must
# survive into the mapping `locals()` / `vars()` / `dir()` hand back, including
# when the trace folds those builtins.
#
# `framelocalsproxy_setitem` sends such a key to `FrameDebugData.w_extra_locals`
# and touches neither a fast slot nor `w_locals`, and
# `frame_locals_proxy_snapshot` copies that dict in ahead of the fastlocals.
# Both `locals()` folds rebuild the mapping WITHOUT it -- the callee arm from
# `CalleeLocalsShadow`, the portal arm from the virtualizable's slot array --
# so each needs its own gate on `w_extra_locals` rather than reading a null
# `w_locals` as "this frame carries no mapping".  Neither gate existed:
# compiled runs answered `['f', 'x', 'y']` where `PYRE_JIT=0` answered
# `['extra_key', 'f', 'x', 'y']`.
#
# The two folds are separate code paths reached by separate gates, so both are
# driven here: `probe_callee_extra` calls the builtin one frame in, where the
# tracer answers from the inlined callee's shadow, and `probe_portal_extra`
# calls it in the compiled loop's own frame, where it answers from the standard
# virtualizable.  `dir()` rides the same gate through its sorted-names tail.
#
# `probe_plain` carries no proxy write at all, so the fold still FIRES there.
# It is what keeps the fixture honest: the two gates above are declines, and a
# fixture built only from declines passes just as well with the whole fold
# deleted.  The `spec-folds` header censuses `builtin_locals` and fails the run
# unless it fired at least once, which only `probe_plain` can supply.
