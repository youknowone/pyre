# pyre-check: selfcheck
# pyre-check: selfcheck-compiles=hot,root:rec
# The `root:` arm is the premise, not a relaxation: the activations this
# fixture walks are owed precisely because `rec` compiles and its recursive
# call is folded into `CALL_ASSEMBLER`. A `rec` that stopped compiling would
# make every walk below pass without testing anything.
# A warm self-recursive callee reaches its own compiled loop through
# `CALL_ASSEMBLER`, and the callee frame that fold hands the assembler is built
# out of recorded operations rather than by the interpreter's call door.
#
# `pyframe.py execute_frame` runs `ec.enter(self)` before the merge point and
# `ec.leave(...)` in a `finally` after it, which is what puts an activation on
# the `topframeref` / `f_backref` chain `sys._getframe` walks. Upstream's merge
# point is on `PyFrame.dispatch` (`interp_jit.py`), so a CALL_ASSEMBLER that
# replaces it is recorded with the enter already traced ahead of it. pyre's
# portal sits one level up, at `execute_frame`, so the fold jumped over both
# halves: the frame it minted was never linked, and every activation the
# assembler ran was invisible to a stack walk.
#
# THE SHAPE IS THE TEST: `rec(DEPTH)` is exactly DEPTH + 1 activations of `rec`,
# stacked contiguously between the probe and the caller. Measured before the
# fix the walk found ONE `rec` frame at every depth — the outermost, the only
# one that still went through the interpreter — so `f_back` ran straight from
# the innermost body to the module frame.
#
# TWO DEPTHS ARE ALSO A TEST: a chain that is linked for the first level only,
# or that is off by a constant, tracks neither. The two walks must differ by
# exactly the difference between the depths.
