# pyre-check: selfcheck
# pyre-check: selfcheck-loops=1
# pyre-check: spec-folds=frame_lasti
# Self-checking guard for the coordinate an app-level `f_lasti` read reports
# for the frame that is running it.
#
# `pyframe.py fget_f_lasti` is loop-free and carries no hint, so
# `policy.py look_inside_graph` traces through it, `jtransform.py
# rewrite_op_jit_force_virtualizable` deletes the injected force, and
# `pyjitpl.py opimpl_getfield_vable_i` answers the field out of
# `virtualizable_boxes` -- a constant, because the bytecode dispatch stored one
# there.  The read neither forces the virtualizable nor needs a residual, and
# pyre folds it to the constant its own LOAD_ATTR coordinate names.
#
# A wrong constant is invisible in one iteration, so every site collects a SET
# across the run: the loop compiles part-way through, so an interpreted answer
# and a compiled one that disagree appear as a SECOND element rather than as
# one shifted value.
#
# `co_positions()` is the oracle for the coordinate itself.  Indexing it with
# `f_lasti // 2` is what a `dis` consumer does, so it pins BOTH halves of the
# adaptation the getset performs (`typedef.rs` returns `fget_f_lasti() * 2`
# over an instruction-unit field): a missing factor lands on the wrong row, and
# a pc short by one lands on the previous instruction.  Site C is where that
# second failure becomes a line difference -- its `.f_lasti` is the FIRST
# instruction of its own line, so the row before it belongs to the line above.
