# Regression guard: SIGSEGV from a NULL operand-stack slot written by the
# single-frame blackhole's ContinueRunningNormally handoff.
#
# The walk roots at `main`, which HAS a Python loop, so its portal jitcode
# carries a jit_merge_point at the loop header. A sys._getframe force inside the
# loop latched a blackhole image built at the resume pc just past the residual;
# driving it ran to the loop back edge and raised ContinueRunningNormally at the
# merge point. The MIFrame is seeded from the live colors at the BUILD pc, but
# the merge point has its own live set, so a Ref color live at the merge but not
# at the build read back NULL -- and apply_blackhole_crn had no NULL guard, so it
# wrote a null into a live operand-stack slot. Resuming there faulted the
# interpreter (EXC_BAD_ACCESS at 0x0 in baseobjspace::next), exit 139, JIT-only.
#
# The walk's own flush declines exactly this case ("NULL operand-stack shadow
# slot (mid-expression)"); the blackhole path did not.
#
# Guarding it post-drive is NOT sufficient and this fixture also pins that: a
# post-drive decline discards a region the drive already executed and hands it
# back to the replay, which turned 199990000 into 200005595.
#
# This shape is also the one that exposed the two defects behind that NULL. The
# image seeded only the colors live at the build pc rather than the whole
# concrete bank; and the walk synchronized the virtualizable into the
# snapshot_for_tracing copy while the image's vable identity pointed at the live
# frame, so the drive read locals one Python iteration stale and accumulated
# total += 1039 where i was already 1040.
#
# None of that is reachable here: the CRN handoff does not rebuild the frame
# from the terminal register banks, so there is no NULL to write and nothing
# to decline.
#
# This file does not reach the blackhole at all. The constant-depth
# `sys._getframe` fold (#1096) answers the `_getframe(0)` below out of the portal
# virtualizable, so nothing escapes, nothing aborts, and the loop simply
# compiles: the committed baselines record
# `fbw_blackhole_adopted_single_frame=0`, `loops_aborted=0`, `loops_compiled=1`
# on all three backends. What it guards is the output. The unfolded counters,
# and with them the CRN machinery described above, are carried by the
# `_declined` sibling
# (`getframe_root_loop_force_blackhole_crn_declined`), which repeats this shape
# at a force the fold declines and records 5 adopts / 5 aborts.
#
# The drive's effects are idempotent, though, which is exactly what hid the
# residual heap half of a post-drive decline — see the `_nonidempotent` sibling.
