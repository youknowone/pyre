# Two function-entry comprehension loops (`single_comp`, `pair_comp`); each
# virtualizes an inner list whose backing is NewArray/NewArrayClear. wasm
# compiles each as its own module.
# An inlined list comprehension whose LIST_APPEND element is a non-empty nested
# list (`[[i] …]` / `[[i, i + 1] …]`). The inner list is virtual; its
# NewArray / NewArrayClear backing has no jitcode-liveness color. The append
# body is not a speculative-replay sub-walk, so that backing is bound at every
# guard-exit deopt without an extra resume-data root. dynasm, cranelift, and
# wasm print the same total.
