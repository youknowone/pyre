# Every Python activation consumes recursion budget, not only an activation
# whose code object is already present in the live call chain.  The six
# distinct callees below each carry a loop so a warmed caller can cross their
# entries through compiled portal/CALL_ASSEMBLER paths.
#
# The two limits pin the conservative lower-level check used by PyPy's
# approximative recursion limit. On this six-callee compiled shape, `base + 5`
# admits the chain while `base + 4` refuses its last aggregate activation.
# Charging recursive code objects only would let the second case return
# normally.
#
# `pypy/module/sys/vm.py setrecursionlimit` is `@jit.dont_look_inside` and
# explicitly documents this limit as approximative and checked at a lower
# level. This fixture therefore pins pyre's conservative compiled seam rather
# than claiming CPython's exact frame-count boundary.
