# pyre-check: selfcheck
# Self-checking regression guard for `force_all_frames`
# (`executioncontext.rs`), the only frame-materializing consumer in the tree
# that no fixture reached.
#
# Both of its callers install a hook that will be handed frames the JIT may
# still be holding virtual, so both force the whole stack first:
# `settrace` calls it with `is_being_profiled=False` and `setllprofile` -- the
# implementation behind `setprofile` -- with `True`.  This fixture drives both
# arms, because they are separate call sites and only the second one also
# stamps `is_being_profiled` on every frame it walks.
#
# The discriminator is a caller local read back through the forced frame.
# `middle` is called from inside the compiled inner loop, so its frame is the
# one an inline sub-walk keeps virtual; `witness` is computed in it and never
# read by `middle` itself, so nothing but the force can put the current value
# where `f_locals` finds it.  A stale materialization returns an earlier
# round's number, and every round uses a different one.
#
# `entered` fails the fixture if the inner loop stops being entered, and
# `hook_calls` fails it if the hook was never installed -- either would make
# the check pass without the forced read ever happening.
