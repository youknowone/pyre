# A loop body fat enough that one traced iteration runs past `trace_limit`, so
# the trace overflows before it can close. `blackhole_if_trace_too_long`
# (`pyjitpl.py:2812-2830`) finds no inlinable huge function here, so it calls
# `prepare_trace_segmenting` (`pyjitpl.py:2831-2859`), which marks the green key
# with the force-finish flag and asks for the next iteration to be traced again.
#
# On that retry the marked key is supposed to CUT: once the trace passes 0.8x
# `trace_limit` at a `jit_merge_point`, `pyjitpl.py:1617-1620` appends
# `GUARD_ALWAYS_FAILS`, compiles what it has, and blackholes with
# `ABORT_SEGMENTED_TRACE`. The cut arm is what turns the key's forever-retracing
# into compiled code.
#
# Without the cut, every retry runs into the same overflow and aborts again:
# `loops_aborted` read 64 with `bridges_compiled` 0 and `guard_failures` 11918.
# With it the key segments and the workload runs out of compiled arms instead.
#
# The 0.8x check only has something to fire at if a merge point is CROSSED while
# the trace sits in the 0.8x..1.0x band, so the body size and `trace_limit` are
# load-bearing together, not independently: at `trace_limit=200` the same body
# jumps the band in one crossing and never segments.
#
# CPython (the oracle) has no `pypyjit`; PyPy and pyre do. Guarding the import
# keeps the output identical across all three while the params only bind where a
# JIT exists. `set_param` rather than an environment variable because the wasm
# guest sees no environment.
