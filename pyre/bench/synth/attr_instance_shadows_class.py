# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=265
# pypy's exec time is pinned to the startup-subtraction floor here, so the
# ratio is not a measurement: the ceiling is twice the slowest ratio the CI
# runners observe (131.0x), rounded up.
# An instance attribute shadows a same-named non-data-descriptor class
# attribute on builtin-type subclasses (tuple/int/str), while a data descriptor
# still wins over a competing instance-dict entry (injected directly, since the
# data descriptor's no-op __set__ never writes __dict__). Output verified
# against CPython/PyPy.
