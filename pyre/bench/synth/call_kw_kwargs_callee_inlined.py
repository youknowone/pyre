# A `**kwargs` callee the inline takes: the keywords no parameter names are
# collected into a fresh kwargs-strategy dict (`_match_signature`), built by
# residual stores the trace records, and the callee body reads it.  The loop
# covers an empty mapping, keywords next to positionals, a positional-only
# name that has to land in the mapping, a keyword overriding a default, a
# callee that also takes `*args`, and a mapping the callee mutates; the
# printed tuples pin every binding, and the final TypeError pins that a
# duplicate binding still raises.
