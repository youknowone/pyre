# Deep operand-stack Variables across a nested-call deopt guard.
# Several computed Variables (x, y, z) sit deep on the stack as arguments being
# marshalled for `acc(...)` while `mul(i, i)` (a residual call that can guard /
# deopt) evaluates. A guard resume there must reconstruct the deep-stack
# argument Variables.
