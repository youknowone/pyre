# str subscripts resolve a code point index, not a byte offset, for every
# payload width, and a slice keeps that indexing under negative and skipping
# steps. bytes/bytearray iterate their live buffer as ordinals, so a bytearray
# resized mid-loop is observed by the cursor rather than frozen at iter() time.
# A non-ASCII payload resolves its subscript through a code point index table
# built once per string, so `groups` walks strings long enough to span several
# of its entries and folds every index, both signs, plus the stride and group
# boundaries and slices crossing them, into one number per payload kind. A
# wrong byte offset anywhere changes that number.
# The warm loops run the ASCII and wide subscripts and the bytes cursor hot
# first so the traced paths are the ones under test; `warm_wide` scatters its
# reads over a long payload, so a regression to resolving each subscript by
# walking the buffer costs orders of magnitude rather than staying flat.
# Output verified against CPython/PyPy.
