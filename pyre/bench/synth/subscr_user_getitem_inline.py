# BINARY_SUBSCR whose receiver resolves `__getitem__` to a Python function.
# Covers the two receiver shapes whose subscript the type's own MRO owns — a
# user instance and a builtin sequence subclass that overrides `__getitem__` —
# plus the three ways the resolution can change under a hot loop: a second
# receiver class flowing into the same site, an `__getitem__` reassigned on the
# class mid-loop, and an instance-dict `__getitem__` (which a special-method
# lookup must ignore). Deterministic.
