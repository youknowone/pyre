# Regression oracle: nested try/except where each handler reads
# `sys.exc_info()`.  After an inner handler unwinds, POP_EXCEPT must restore the
# slot to the prev its matching PUSH_EXC_INFO saved (the outer ValueError), and
# after the outer handler to None.  Expected per-iteration signature
# 2*1 + 1*10 + 0*100 = 12 → 360000.
#
# Was `_pending/`: the JIT answered 3320000 (trait) / 3360000 (FBW walker)
# because the nested handlers' POP_EXCEPT restores were not lowered to the EC
# `sys_exc_value` slot — the in-handler `sys.exc_info()` may-force ended the
# authoritative walk, so the slot kept the inner exception after the handler
# exited.  Both tracers now answer 360000, matching the interpreter and CPython.
