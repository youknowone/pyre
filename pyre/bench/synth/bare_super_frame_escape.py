# pyre-check: spec-folds=bare_super_call,bare_super_virtual
# Self-checking guard for zero-argument `super()` bound to a name, which is the
# spelling that reaches the frame-escape path.
#
# The two spellings do not share a route.  `super().m()` compiles to
# LOAD_SUPER_ATTR, which the JIT lowers to a frame-explicit residual: the red
# frame travels as an operand and `builtin_super_from_frame` reads it, so the
# force happens through the may-force channel the walker already models.
# `s = super()` compiles to LOAD_GLOBAL super + CALL, which reaches
# `builtin_super`'s zero-argument tail, and that calls
# `ExecutionContext::gettopframe()` -- whose `force_frame` runs INSIDE an opaque
# residual and clears TOKEN_TRACING_RESCALL, which the walker reads back as
# `VableEscapedDuringResidualCall`.
#
# Measured on this shape, 200k iterations, dynasm: `super().val()` reports
# loops_aborted=0 abrt_escape=0 fbw_force_by_portal=0, while `s = super()`
# reports 5/5/5 -- same answer, different route.
#
# So this fixture is coverage of a route, not of a wrong answer: the escape
# aborts a recording walk and the interpreter finishes the iteration, which is
# why the answer stays correct while the loop stops compiling.  A regression
# that made the escape return a WRONG proxy -- the outer portal frame's `self`
# and `__class__` instead of the executing frame's -- would be invisible to a
# counter and is exactly what the sites below pin.
#
# Sites:
#   A  a method that binds `super()` to a name and calls through it, so the
#      proxy must resolve against A's own class, not its caller's.
#   B  the same in a callee the loop can inline, where the frame the proxy is
#      built from is the callee's own and not the portal's.  A proxy built
#      from the wrong frame answers with the caller's `__class__` cell and so
#      returns the caller's override.
#   C  a three-deep chain, so a proxy built one level off is still wrong but
#      would not be caught by a two-level shape alone.
#   D  a receiver `super_check` rejects by walking MROs, so the fold declines
#      before running anything and the generic residual owns the TypeError.
#   E  a receiver `super_check` can only classify by asking Python, which the
#      fold also declines.  E carries per-iteration data in its exception on
#      purpose: D's message is identical every iteration, so D alone cannot
#      tell a correctly-declined call from a folded one that answers with the
#      RECORDING-time exception object.  E can — that answer collapses the
#      distinct-message count, and it is what an earlier version of this fold
#      did (20000 iterations, 1662 distinct).  E also pins that the `__class__`
#      property runs exactly once per iteration, which a fold that executed the
#      call and then declined would double.
#   F  the loop INSIDE the super-bearing method, so the frame the proxy is
#      built from is the portal's own rather than an inlined callee's.  The
#      two frames reach `walker_bare_super_frame_slots` on different channels
#      -- A/B/C through the callee slot shadow, F through the standard
#      virtualizable -- and a fold that read only one of them would answer for
#      the wrong frame on the other.
#   G  a method whose own `self` is also a cellvar, because a nested function
#      closes over it.  Slot zero then holds a `Cell` rather than the receiver;
#      the virtual fold must perform the same guarded live dereference as
#      LOAD_DEREF.
#   H  a method that has already rebound its `__class__` cell.  The virtual
#      fold must decline once `CellFamily.ever_mutated` is set, leaving the
#      frame-explicit `bare_super_call` re-route live.  Together G and H keep
#      both labels in the `spec-folds` header above covered.
