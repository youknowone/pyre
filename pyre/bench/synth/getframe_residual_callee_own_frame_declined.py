# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=32
# Historical `_declined` companion to `getframe_residual_callee_own_frame`.
# Exact `_getframe(0).f_locals` now remains traced and owns the callee's exact
# red frame, so it neither forces that frame nor clears the caller's
# virtualizable token.
#
# The recorded shape is two loops, no bridge, no forcings, no virtualizable
# forcings, and no aborts.  The observable regression guard remains the
# non-journaled `STORE_ATTR`: frame inspection must execute `bump` exactly once
# per iteration, so `c.n` must stay equal to the loop count.
