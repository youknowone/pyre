# A callee catches a residual-call exception in-frame and RETURNS a sentinel
# into a JIT-hot outer loop.  When the callee gets hot enough that a bridge is
# compiled for the exception-guard (GUARD_NO_EXCEPTION) failure on the
# caught-KeyError path, the bridge must not be built from the guard's
# no-exception fallthrough resume_pc (which would record `Finish` of the NULL
# raised-call result and hand a NULL back to the caller — "call failed").  The
# bridge tracer declines the caught-in-frame exception-guard case so the
# blackhole resume routes the exception to the handler and returns the sentinel.
