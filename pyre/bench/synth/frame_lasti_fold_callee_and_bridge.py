# pyre-check: selfcheck
# pyre-check: spec-folds=frame_lasti
# Self-checking guard for the `f_lasti` coordinate on the two frames a walk
# owns that are NOT the loop's own portal: the frame of an inlined callee, and
# the caller's frame read from inside one.
#
# The virtualizable boxes describe the PORTAL frame only, so a read inside an
# inlined callee cannot answer from them -- `pyjitpl.py` keeps one MIFrame per
# inlined call and each carries its own coordinate.  pyre's walker mirrors that
# with a per-level source: an inline sub-walk resolves the callee's own jitcode
# pc through its own metadata, and the caller keeps the CALL boundary it is
# suspended at.  Two sources behind one witness, so both need a site here.
#
# The cold arm compiles as a guard-failure bridge off the hot loop, which
# records its `f_lasti` read at a pc the loop trace never held.
#
# Every site collects a SET: the loop compiles part-way through, so an
# interpreted answer and a compiled one that disagree appear as a second
# element rather than as one shifted value.  `co_positions()` indexed by
# `f_lasti // 2` is the oracle for the coordinate, the way a `dis` consumer
# reads it.
