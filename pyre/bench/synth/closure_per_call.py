# Regression guard for the per-call-created nested closure JIT hang.
#
# `add` is defined fresh on every `make` call, and `make` is driven from a
# hot outer loop.  Each nested code constant must realize to one shared code
# object (stable `__code__` identity / JIT green key), so the trace give-up
# counter accumulates and the JIT stops re-tracing the dead closure.  When the
# code object is re-materialized per call instead, every closure instance gets
# a fresh green key, the give-up never sticks, and tracing thrashes
# super-linearly until this bench times out.
