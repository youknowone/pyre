# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=28
# An exception escaping a compiled frame that holds a try block it does NOT
# match used to lose the CALLER's traceback node:
#
#   before:  ('d_nonmatching_except', 'mid', 'leaf')
#   after:   ('<module>', 'd_nonmatching_except', 'mid', 'leaf')
#
# The non-matching clause falls through to the except-cleanup RERAISE, so the
# blackhole classified the exiting frame as a bare reraise and cleared
# `attach_tb` on the escaping error.  That flag suppresses one frame's
# traceback record, and the compiled frame never runs `handle_exception`
# itself - so the first frame to read it was the interpreter caller, which
# then dropped its own node.  The compiled frame's own record decision is
# already made where the record is skipped, so the flag must not leave it.
#
# `d_no_try` is the control: with no try block in the compiled frame the
# escape takes the guard-exception exit, which never touched `attach_tb`, and
# the caller node survived even before the fix.  `d_finally` and
# `d_while_nonmatching` cover the other two cleanup shapes that reach the same
# RERAISE, and `d_no_mid` pins that neither an inlined intermediate frame nor
# a compiled exception-edge bridge is needed to trigger it.
