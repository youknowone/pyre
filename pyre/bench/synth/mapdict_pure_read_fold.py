# pyre-check: spec-folds=load_attr_pure_read
# `AbstractAttribute.read` answers through the `@jit.elidable`
# `_pure_direct_read` when the attribute and the receiver are both green and
# `ever_mutated` is still false.  Without it the trace keeps the three loads
# `_prim_direct_read` is -- the storage block, the attribute's slot, and the
# item -- and carries all of them across the loop back edge.
#
# Both storage shapes take the fold: a boxed slot through
# `PlainAttribute._pure_direct_read` and an unboxed one through
# `UnboxedPlainAttribute._pure_unboxed_read`, whose boxing stays visible to the
# trace so a numeric consumer still unwraps the constant.
#
# The deopt arms -- a write, a delete, a devolved dict, a sibling instance's
# write, and a slot -- live in
# `extra_tests/parity_tests/mapdict_pure_read_deopt_arms.py`; this fixture only
# proves the fold fires and that the answer survives a mid-loop rebind.
