# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=45
# Merged synth parity smoke suite: independent feature-level hot loops, each
# kept from its former standalone file with module-level names prefixed by the
# source name. Bug-repro / resume / kept-stack tests are NOT merged (they stay
# isolated so a miscompile is not diluted). check.py runs every *.py here.
#
# Every trip count is half what the standalone files used, which is the one
# deliberate departure from them. At the old counts this file's old-gen use
# crossed the major-collection threshold check.py pins, and the resulting
# eval-breaker bailout re-entered through a bridge whose guard then failed --
# one extra `guard_failures` that appeared or not depending on where the
# crossing landed. That placement moves with total allocation volume, so it
# differed per backend, per host, and per environment size, and no recorded
# baseline could hold: the counter read 657 or 658 for reasons having nothing
# to do with the code under test. Halved, the file does not reach the threshold
# at all (`back_edge_polls=0`) and both backends read 657.
#
# Guard failures arise at trace transitions rather than per iteration, so
# `guard_failures`, `loops_compiled` and `bridges_compiled` are unchanged by the
# halving -- measured 657/6/3 on both native backends at 0.4x, 0.5x and 0.6x,
# against 657 (dynasm) and 658 (cranelift) at the old counts. Trip counts still
# clear the compile threshold by two orders of magnitude. Keep them well below
# the crossing: 0.7x reaches it again.
