# A loop nested inside a yield-bearing loop. The inner loop's body holds no
# suspension — it runs to completion between two yields — so it is an ordinary
# counted loop and compiles like one. The enclosing loop is a different matter
# and still declines, correctly, because a trace cannot cross a yield.
#
# The shape exists because the loop-body region for the inner loop used to be
# closed by the ENCLOSING loop's back edge, which stretched the region over the
# yield and declined a body that never goes near one. A sibling loop was
# unaffected, so nesting is the variable this fixture pins.
