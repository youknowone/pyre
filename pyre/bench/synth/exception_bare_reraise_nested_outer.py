# Bare `raise` inside a nested handler whose re-raise must reach the OUTER
# handler, exercised under a bridge resume that lands inside the inner handler.
#
# Unlike exception_bare_reraise_restore.py (which only restores the current-
# exception slot), this shape adds a third inner branch (i % 3) so the catch
# landing of the inner handler shares a resume color with the virtualizable
# frame `f_code` scalar.  At a bridge resuming into the inner handler at the
# bare `raise`, the walker reconstructs the PUSH_EXC_INFO operand-stack slot
# from the per-PC resume map; if it aliases the const-folded `f_code` the
# published current exception becomes a code object and the later blackhole
# re-raise reports `TypeError: exceptions must derive from BaseException`
# instead of routing ValueError to the outer handler.
#
#   i % 3 == 0 -> raise ValueError -> inner except (inner++)
#                   then i % 2 == 0 -> bare raise -> outer except (outer++)
#   i % 3 != 0 -> clean path (clean++)
#
# With N=200000: inner=66667, outer=33334, clean=133333; inner+clean=200000.
# Deterministic.
