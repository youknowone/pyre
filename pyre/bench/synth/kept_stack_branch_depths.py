# Kept-stack branch-guard recovery across resume depths.
#
# A `goto_if_not` whose not-taken arm resumes with operand-stack temps live is
# the short-circuit / conditional / chained-comparison shape.  The full-body
# walk recovers the kept value(s) from the guard-pc register file:
#
#   depth 1 (recovered) — `(i % k) and/or v` keeps a SINGLE operand-stack temp
#   across the guard; the recovery substitutes one color, no ambiguity.
#
#   depth > 1 (declined to the trait tracer) — `a + ((i & 1) or v)` and the
#   triple-chained `0 < a < b < 9` keep TWO+ operand-stack temps across one
#   guard.  A wrong-order recovery would transpose the kept values; the
#   asymmetric weighting below makes any transposition change the checksum.
#
# Pure arithmetic -> deterministic checksum across runtimes; a parity
# regression target for the kept-stack branch-guard depth boundary.
