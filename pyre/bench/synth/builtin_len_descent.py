# pyre-check: spec-folds=builtin_len_descent
# PyPy installs the builtin implementations reached by
# descroperation.py `_len` through typedef.py
# `use_special_method_shortcut('__len__')`.  Keep every layout formerly emitted
# by the hand-written builtin_len fold on the generated gateway descent: list
# strategies, ordinary and specialised pairs, set/frozenset, range, unicode,
# bytes, and mutable bytearray.  The shared inner loop deliberately retraces
# across layouts; every result contributes to one checksum.
