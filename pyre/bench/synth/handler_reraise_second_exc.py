# A named `except X as m:` handler that raises a SECOND exception of a
# different class (conditionally, alongside a bare reraise) while the function
# also has a sibling `except` clause, and a hot `return` path. The func-entry
# JIT trace forms on the return path; the cold raise deopts through the
# blackhole, which must propagate the handler-raised exception out of the
# function (a sibling clause does NOT catch a handler-raised exception) so the
# caller routes it to the correct `except`. Output verified against CPython/PyPy.
