# A loop-callee that constructs a user object via a *type* call and reads
# an attribute off it.  When the outer loop is traced, `make` is inlined
# and its body is concretely executed step by step; the `P(i)` CALL runs
# through the inline residual-call path.  That path must support every
# callable kind the normal call path does — here a type (class) — or the
# constructed instance is lost and the subsequent `.a` read dereferences
# null.
