# A kept-stack short-circuit inside a pending method call aborts tracing after
# the authoritative walk has already advanced a stateful reader.
#
# RPython's `MIFrame.run_one_step` has selected the POP_JUMP successor and
# advanced `frame.pc` before a tracing abort is converted to blackhole frames.
# The blackhole therefore continues with the post-branch stack.  Rewinding to
# the branch opcode needs its already-popped truth operand; rewinding farther
# to the trace entry re-runs `fp.read(1)` and loses one byte.  Iteration 2 is
# where the function-entry trace becomes hot enough to expose that replay.
