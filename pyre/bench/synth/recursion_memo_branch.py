# The first three carry most of the corpus's fold traffic, and nothing
# declared any of them, so switching one off was a silent change. This fixture
# fires all three repeatedly, the widest margin of any fixture doing so.
# `compare_op_int` used to fire 61 times here, on the int compares whose
# descent declined at a helper call inside the compare helper's body; that
# call now resumes at the enclosing helper, the descent takes those sites, and
# the hand fold has been removed.
# Memoized vs plain recursion with post-warm-up branch divergence. The
# memo-dict store (memo[n] = r) once died with a TypeError after warm-up
# (an empty-string type name from a clobbered class read on the dict-store
# path during a deopt-resumed recursive frame). Deterministic; divergence
# (deeper args, branch flip) starts after the loop is compiled.
