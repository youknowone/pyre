# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=90
# Every traceback node keeps the line its frame was executing, including for
# a frame the JIT compiled and exited with an uncaught exception.
#
# `handle_exception` stamps the node with `frame.last_instr` and compiled code
# never runs the interpreter's per-opcode store, so an intermediate frame that
# only forwards the call reports its `def` line unless the trace publishes the
# raise coordinate before finishing. The pre-compile iterations report the call
# line, so the shape has to be surveyed over the whole run rather than sampled
# once: a single miscompiled frame turns one (name, lineno) tuple into two.
