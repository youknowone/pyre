# Deep operand-stack Variables kept across a short-circuit guard, pure and
# mutating.
#
# `g(i)` and `h(i)` are computed Variables held deep on the stack while the
# `p or q` short-circuit guard decides the third tuple element. A guard resume
# must restore the deep-stack g(i)/h(i).
#
# The mutating half holds the same Variables across the same guard, but its
# helpers each append to a shared global list (a non-journaled
# STORE_SUBSCR-class heap effect committed inside a user frame).  A FOR_ITER
# trace that consumes the iterator, aborts on the deep kept-stack guard, and
# then DELIVERS the in-flight item would re-run the body and DOUBLE the
# mutation.  The `log` length must equal 3x the iteration count exactly (g, h,
# and one conditional g/h append per iteration): a doubled delivery
# over-counts, a dropped iteration under-counts.
