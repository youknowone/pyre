# An `except E as e:` handler whose exception variable `e` is captured by a
# nested function makes `e` a cell variable, so the implicit handler cleanup
# emits DELETE_DEREF (clear the cell contents) rather than DELETE_FAST. The
# traced DELETE_DEREF dereferences the cell to raise if unbound, then clears
# its contents; this bench pins that a captured-exception handler in a hot
# loop compiles and returns byte-identically.
