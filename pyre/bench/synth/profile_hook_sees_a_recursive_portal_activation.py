# pyre-check: selfcheck
# pyre-check: selfcheck-compiles=hot,root:rec
# The `root:` arm is the premise, not a relaxation: the activations this
# fixture counts are owed precisely because `rec` reaches the JIT and its
# recursive calls leave through the portal runner. A `rec` that stopped
# compiling would make every count below pass without testing anything.
# A profile hook is installed over a loop whose callee calls ITSELF, and the
# recursive activations are the ones a compiled caller performs through the
# portal runner rather than through the interpreter's call door.
#
# `pyframe.py execute_frame` brackets every activation with `ec.call_trace` and
# `leave`'s `_trace('leaveframe')`. pyre's portal sits at `execute_frame` level
# rather than at `dispatch` where upstream's merge point is, so the portal
# carries that bracket itself — and only the ROOT portal entry carried it. The
# recursive entries (`bhimpl_recursive_call_*` -> `bh_portal_runner_c`, the
# CALL_ASSEMBLER force leg, `compile_tmp_callback`'s callback loop, and the
# `jit_force_*_recursive_call_*` helpers) all reach the same portal body with a
# callee frame they built a line earlier, and reported nothing.
#
# THE SHAPE IS THE TEST: `rec(DEPTH)` is exactly DEPTH + 1 activations, so the
# owed count is a multiple of the tail that no partial reporting can reach by
# accident. Measured before the fix, `call/rec` read exactly `tail` from tail
# 10 000 upward — one activation per iteration, the outermost, which is the one
# that still goes through the interpreter — while cpython 3.14.6 reports
# `(DEPTH + 1) * tail`.
#
# THE TAIL IS ALSO A TEST: the loss was total and permanent from the moment
# compiled code took the caller over, so each count is checked at TWO tails and
# must track the difference between them. A count that saturates fails however
# large it is.
#
# `settrace` is checked alongside `setprofile` because they fail differently:
# `w_tracefunc` is guarded at the merge point, so arming a tracer exits compiled
# code, while `is_being_profiled` is a portal green, so arming a profiler mints
# a different cell that KEEPS the JIT and leaves the call a residual. Only the
# second reaches the portal entries this fixture is about, so a fixture that
# armed only a tracer would pass without testing anything.
