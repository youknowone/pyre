# Regression guard: a residual (may-force) callee that inspects its OWN frame

# token. Clearing it raised a spurious frame-escape with no committed resume pc,
# replaying the loop body from entry and double-applying the callee's
# non-journaled STORE_ATTR side effect -- a JIT-only wrong answer (c.n > loops).
