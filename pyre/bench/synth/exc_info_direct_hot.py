# PyPy's `vm.py exc_info_direct` lets `function.py funccall_valuestack`
# omit the traceback when bytecode look-ahead proves that only slots 0/1 can
# escape.  A residual `sys.exc_info()` call used to allocate its three-tuple
# and repeatedly force the trace in each of these loops.  Keep the workload
# large enough that PyPy's execution-only time is measurable after startup
# subtraction; before the direct-call fold the pyre run takes tens of seconds.
