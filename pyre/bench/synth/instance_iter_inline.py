# pyre-check: selfcheck
# pyre-check: selfcheck-compiles=self_iter,nested_call,in_callee
# pyre-check: spec-folds=instance_iter
# `iter`'s instance arm dispatches a user class's `__iter__` and then runs
# `iter_check_is_iterator` on what came back.  Left residual the method is one
# opaque `CallMayForce` per `for` statement -- a real interpreter frame, plus
# the `ForceToken` / virtualref shell that forces the caller's frame around it
# -- even when the body is the `return self` every iterator class writes.
#
# `instance_iter` inlines the body in its place.  The check it owes is decided
# at record time against the class the receiver guard pins under the type's
# `_version_tag?`, and only for the shape where the body hands the receiver's
# own box back; anything else keeps the residual, which runs the check itself.
#
# The arms that must NOT take the fold -- a `__iter__` returning a fresh
# object, a `__iter__ = None`, a receiver with no `__next__`, and a mid-loop
# rebind -- live in `extra_tests/parity_tests/instance_iter_deopt_arms.py`.
