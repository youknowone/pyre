# No `max-pypy-ratio`: the only loop here is the two-statement `while` driver,
# so a pypy ratio compares two interpreters' startup rather than any generated
# code, and reads whatever the host's process spawn cost happens to be that
# run. The jitstats baselines gate it.
# The callee's frame OUTLIVES the call and its f_back is read after the loop.
#
# The callee's frame is captured at depth 0 (`kept = _gf()`) and its `f_back`
# is read after the loop; `_gf(1).f_lasti` now folds on the portal red box
# instead of forcing a multi-frame adopt.  `kept.f_back` must still name
# `main` after the compiled loop finishes.
