# Merged synth parity smoke suite: independent feature-level hot loops, each
# kept verbatim from its former standalone file with module-level names prefixed
# by the source name. Bug-repro / resume / kept-stack tests are NOT merged (they
# stay isolated so a miscompile is not diluted). check.py runs every *.py here.
