# pyre-check: selfcheck
# pyre-check: selfcheck-interpreted
# The empty compile set is measured, not a relaxation: `PYRE_LOOP_CENSUS=1`
# emits no `[loop-census]` line for this file. The defect is on the portal's
# COLD path — `eval_with_jit_inner` consumed the resume payload before entering
# the bracket, which every frame reaching the portal does whether or not
# anything compiled — so warming a loop would add nothing to the guard. The
# discriminator is the JIT build against `PYRE_JIT=0`, not compiled against
# interpreted: `PYRE_JIT=0` reports all six events and the default build
# reported two.
#
# A delegating generator / coroutine is resumed with a hook installed, and the
# activation of the DELEGATING frame is the one being counted.
#
# `pyframe.py execute_frame` puts the resume INSIDE the bracket:
#
#     executioncontext.enter(self)
#     try:
#         executioncontext.call_trace(self)
#         try:
#             try:
#                 next_instr = self.resume_execute_frame(w_arg_or_err)
#             except pyopcode.Yield:
#                 w_exitvalue = self.popvalue()
#         finally:
#             executioncontext.return_trace(self, w_exitvalue)
#     finally:
#         executioncontext.leave(self, w_exitvalue, got_exception)
#
# pyre's portal sits at `execute_frame`'s own level, so it carries that bracket
# itself — but it consumed the resume payload BEFORE entering the bracket, and
# a suspended `yield from` / `await` delegate that yields again finishes the
# resumption there and returns. That return jumped `call_trace`,
# `return_trace`, `leaveframe_trace` and the frame-chain leave in one step.
#
# TWO DEFECTS, ONE HOIST, and the fixture checks both because they fail
# differently:
#   * LOSS. When the delegate yields again, the delegating frames report
#     nothing at all. Measured on the `await` arm: 2 of the 6 events cpython
#     3.14, pypy3 and `PYRE_JIT=0` all report.
#   * ORDER. When the delegate instead raises StopIteration, the bracket does
#     run — but the delegate's own Python already ran ahead of it, so the
#     callee's whole call/return pair is reported OUTSIDE the caller's. A
#     pairing profiler mis-nests: it sees a `return` for a frame it never got a
#     `call` for. Measured on the `yield from` arm as
#     `['call/inner', 'return/inner', 'call/outer', 'return/outer']`.
#
# THE ORDER IS THE TEST for the second arm, not the multiset: both orders carry
# the same four events, so a fixture that counted them would pass while the
# nesting was inverted.
