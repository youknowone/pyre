# `StdObjSpace.getattr` (`objspace/std/objspace.py:711-716`) wraps the
# `__getattr__` fallback call in `enrich_attribute_error` (`error.py:725-738`),
# which fills an AttributeError's `name` and `obj` in with the attribute that
# was looked up and the object it was looked up on -- and only when the
# exception carries neither yet, so a hook that sets its own pair keeps it.
#
# `try_walker_inline_getattr_hook` walks the hook body in place of the
# `load_attr_fn` residual that used to reach that enrichment, so the inline
# owes the pair itself.  The binding fixture next to this one covers the
# returning path; this one covers the raising path, where the enrichment is the
# only observable difference between the residual and the inline.
#
# A single access answers from the interpreter, so an assertion that runs once
# proves nothing about the compiled trace.  Each loop below runs long enough
# for the hook to be inlined and re-reads the pair on every iteration.
