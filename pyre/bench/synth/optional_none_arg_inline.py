# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=2.7
# A hot call into a callee that branches on `arg is None` -- the shape every
# optional argument in the standard library takes.  The tested local holds the
# default `None`, a Ref; the other parameter is an int.
#
# The gate is `loops_compiled` first: declined, the callee takes a trace of
# its own and the count reads 2; inlined, it folds into the caller's and reads
# 1. That census is host-independent. On this run dynasm reads 1.0x and
# cranelift 1.3x; the ceiling is twice the slower, and a ceiling under 4
# derives no floor.
#
# Its sibling `is_none_unboxed_operand_decline` is this fixture with the
# default changed from `None` to an int, and stays declined.  The pair is what
# shows the `is`-against-None scan asking about the operand the branch tests
# rather than about the signature as a whole.
#
# `clamp` is called once more off the hot path so the printed total depends on
# the arm the trace guards away as well as the one it keeps: an identity test
# answered the wrong way changes the sum rather than the timing.
