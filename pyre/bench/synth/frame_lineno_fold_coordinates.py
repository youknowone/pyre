# pyre-check: selfcheck
# pyre-check: selfcheck-compiles=main
# pyre-check: spec-folds=frame_lineno
# Self-checking guard for the line an app-level `f_lineno` read reports for the
# frame that is running it.
#
# `pyframe.py fget_f_lineno` decodes `last_instr` against the line table, and
# `last_instr` is a virtualizable field.  A generic reader residualizes
# `space.getattr` as one CALL_MAY_FORCE, and that force is the only reason the
# frame's own copy of the field is current enough to decode.  The fold hands
# the same getter body the coordinate the walk already holds instead, so the
# decode runs with no force -- which means a wrong coordinate surfaces here as
# a wrong LINE rather than as a crash.
#
# One iteration cannot see that.  The loop compiles part-way through, so an
# interpreted answer and a compiled one that disagree appear as a SECOND
# element of a set rather than as one shifted value; every site collects across
# the whole run for that reason.
#
# Sites, and what each one pins:
#   A  the receiver is a fresh local from this statement -- the common shape.
#   B  the receiver was hoisted into a local BEFORE the loop, so the read is
#      not on the frame's own box and the fold owes a `ptr_eq` guard.  Its
#      answer is still the line being EXECUTED, not the line it was hoisted on,
#      which is what separates the frame's current coordinate from the box the
#      receiver arrived in.
#   C  a read spread across physical lines, so the attribute lands on a
#      different line from the statement that starts it.
#   D  a callee reading its OWN frame.  The coordinate source differs by
#      construction there: the portal's virtualizable describes the portal, so
#      a callee read that took it would report the caller's CALL boundary.
#
# Not covered here: `f_lineno` with a trace function installed.  That branch of
# the getter is the same leaf body, but arming local tracing on a compiled
# frame is a separate open defect, so a fixture that armed it would be pinning
# that defect rather than this fold.
