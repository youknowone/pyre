# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=83
# Inlined-callee shared-heap mutation parity, in both helper orderings.
#
# A tiny helper mutates a caller-owned list/instance inside a hot while-loop,
# so the tracer inlines the call and the mutating opcode (LIST_APPEND /
# STORE_ATTR) lands on a SHARED heap object. The final counts must match the
# iteration count exactly: a doubled side effect over-counts, a dropped one
# under-counts.
#
# `append_first` appends before bumping.  `store_first` reverses the order so
# the attribute store commits during recording BEFORE the deliberate
# list.append abort discards the trace: bump(c) traces through (its STORE_ATTR
# side effect commits during the inline concrete step), then push(acc, i) hits
# the append abort and the interpreter restarts the iteration from the
# unadvanced frame, re-running bump.  A recording attempt that aborts after
# the committed store must not leave a doubled side effect.
