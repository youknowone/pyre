# At the 100 it was recorded with, the loop never reached the JIT --
# `loops_compiled=0` on every backend -- and pypy's side sat on the
# execution floor, so the gate compared startup. At 1600 the loop compiles
# and pypy's own execution is a measurement. The ceiling is four times the
# slowest observed (1.8x), fitted on one host until the runners report.
