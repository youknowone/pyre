# pyre-check: spec-folds=len_user_dunder
# `len(obj)` whose receiver resolves `__len__` to a Python function.  Covers
# the two receiver shapes `descroperation.py _len` dispatches a method for -- a
# user instance and a builtin subclass overriding `__len__` -- plus the ways
# the resolution or the result can change under a hot loop: a second receiver
# class flowing into the same site, a `__len__` reassigned on the class
# mid-loop, and an instance-dict `__len__` (which a special-method lookup must
# ignore).  The three results `len()` refuses -- negative, non-int, and a value
# too large for a machine word -- are exercised hot, so the checks around the
# call are read through the compiled trace rather than only at startup, and so
# is the one it converts: `len()` boxes the machine length it checked, so a
# `__len__` answering `True` gives the int 1.
#
# `hot_deopt_*` leave the operator by the OTHER exit: a map change fails a
# guard inside the inlined `__len__` itself, so the body finishes in the
# blackhole.  `space.index`, `_check_len_result` and that box have to run on
# that exit too, which is what `operator_continuation`'s resume level is for.
#
# `nested` and `nested_refused` are the third exit: a `__len__` whose own body
# runs `len()` leaves an executed effect behind it, which a caller-level guard
# could not resume past, so the route declines the call and keeps the
# interpreter's residual rather than aborting the enclosing loop.
# Deterministic.
#
# No `max-pypy-ratio`: pypy folds every loop here away, so its execution-only
# time sits at the floor whatever this fixture is sized to -- measured, the
# reported ratio read 18x at one size and 47x at four times that, which is the
# clamp talking and not the code.  The fold coverage above and the jitstats
# baselines gate it.
