# GC stress for the in-place Object-append write barrier the tracer does NOT
# record. `w_list_append`'s in-place arm stores a GC ref into the items block
# and runs `list_write_barrier`; when the block is GC-managed the backend GC
# rewrite already marks that store with COND_CALL_GC_WB_ARRAY, so the walker
# drops the barrier residual instead of leaving a second barrier in the loop
# (rewrite.py:936-944; pyjitpl records no write barrier at all,
# executor.py:446). These cases pin what that suppression must not break: an
# OLD list whose block is already promoted receiving YOUNG elements. If the
# store went unremembered, a minor collection would never scan the slot and the
# element would be freed or read back stale. Run with PYRE_GC_ITEMSBLOCK=0 too
# — there the block is std::alloc with no GC header, the barrier on the
# W_ListObject is load-bearing, and the walker must keep emitting it.
