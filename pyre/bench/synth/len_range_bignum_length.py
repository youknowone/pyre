# `len()` on ranges whose stored length does and does not fit a machine word.
#
# `functional.py:496-497 W_Range.descr_len` returns the precomputed
# `self.w_length` field, and `descr_new` stores a bignum there whenever
# `compute_range_length` leaves the machine range. The fold reads that field
# behind a class guard, so the loaded box needs its own guard: the receiver
# being an exact range says nothing about what its length slot holds, and the
# hot small ranges below would otherwise let a bignum-length range take their
# recorded exit and hand the bignum straight to `len()`.
