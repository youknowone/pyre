# wasm still prints PASS but compiles `root:callee_d1` after five loop
# aborts, so it cannot declare the native `hot_d1` loop.
# Self-checking regression guard for a caller frame read from inside an inlined
# callee while the caller's compiled loop is still running.
#
# The callee reads non-forcing coordinate fields from `sys._getframe(1)`.  The
# walk answers that call with the portal red box, and `f_lasti` / `f_lineno`
# fold at the CALL the portal is suspended at (`fbw_mode.inline_caller_py_pc`).
# A residual heap `last_instr` used to disagree with that coordinate and show
# up as an extra pre-loop row during the first compiled survey rounds.
