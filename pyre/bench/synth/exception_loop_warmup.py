# Warm-up-then-raise exception handling: the loop runs cleanly long enough to
# compile, then a nested try/(try-finally)/except starts raising only after the
# warm-up window. The post-warm-up raise is therefore NOT in the recorded trace,
# so the guard failure resumes in the blackhole and the exception must hop
# floordiv -> inner finally -> reraise -> outer except entirely under blackhole
# control. Benches that raise from iteration 1 do not exercise this path.
