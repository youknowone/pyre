# `range()` with a bound whose type supplies `__index__`.
# `functional.py:461-474 W_Range.descr_new` converts each bound with
# `space.index`, and `descroperation.py:599-620 _index` carries no JIT hints,
# so the user method is traced into like any other call. The bound is live
# rather than trace-constant, which is what puts the emitted
# `compute_range_length` (functional.py:42-53) on the recorded path: the
# step-sign guard, the emptiness guard and the overflow guards all come from
# the source's own conditionals.
