# pyre-check: max-pypy-ratio=31
# A `for` body that calls two DISTINCT recursive functions and then runs one
# more statement, with the branch it takes flipping after warm-up. Once a callee
# owns a compiled loop the walk aborts the enclosing trace
# (`LoopBearingCalleeInlineUnsupported`) and resumes the caller forward at the
# CALL. That resume rebuilds the caller's operand stack from the overrides
# collected at the CALL, and the `null_or_self` slot a `PUSH_NULL` leaves under
# it has no box in the walk and no distinguishable shadow value — so it used to
# be missing, the resume declined, and the legacy rollback+replay refused
# in-flight FOR_ITER delivery, DROPPING that iteration. The loss is silent: one
# iteration's accumulation never happens and the answer is simply too small.
#
# All three ingredients are required — with one callee, without the branch
# divergence, or without the trailing statement the shape does not abort here.
