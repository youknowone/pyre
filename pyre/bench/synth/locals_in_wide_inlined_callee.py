# `locals()` in an inlined callee whose frame is WIDER than the modelled
# expansion's old ceiling.
#
# `try_walker_specialize_builtin_locals_in_callee_expand` unrolls
# `fast2locals`' slot loop one store per bound slot.  Upstream bounds that
# unroll with nothing but `@jit.unroll_safe` on `pyframe.py`
# `PyFrame.fast2locals` and the tracer's own `trace_limit`
# (`pyjitpl.py` `MetaInterp.blackhole_if_trace_too_long`); the walker used to
# carry a second, fixed ceiling of 32 slots on top of that.
#
# In the portal arm a width refusal costs one residual.  In the callee arm it
# costs the callee: the residual's locals read forces this level's published
# frame, `tracing_after_residual_call` reads the cleared token as
# `VableEscapedDuringResidualCall`, and the walker answers that by denying the
# callee for the rest of the thread's tracing.  So the ceiling decided whether
# a callee is inlinable from its LOCAL COUNT alone.
#
# `wide` carries 42 slots -- `x`, `a00`..`a39` and `d` -- and no other fixture
# reaches the expansion with more than a handful, so the ceiling was a shape
# the corpus did not own.  The gate is the `spec-folds` header: measured on
# release dynasm, this file read `consulted=7 fired=0` with the ceiling in
# place and `consulted=1 fired=1` without it, because the wide callee is the
# only shape it offers.  The name set is asserted too, so a fold that takes
# the shape but answers from the wrong frame fails rather than passing on a
# plausible count -- the answer itself is right either way, since the residual
# the refusal falls back to computes it correctly.
