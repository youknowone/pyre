# pyre-check: selfcheck
# Self-checking regression guard for the cost of walking a MODULE dict's view.
#
# `celldict.py:188-192 getiterkeys`/`getitervalues` are lazy iterators upstream.
# Pyre's dict-view iterator cannot hold one — the GC-object layout has no slot
# for it — so it keeps an integer cursor and asks the strategy for the `index`-th
# entry per step (`DictStrategy::nth_item`).  The trait default answers that by
# materialising `items()` and taking `.nth(index)`, which the doc calls "fine for
# the tiny empty strategies"; `ModuleDictStrategy` had no override, and its
# `items` wraps EVERY name with `w_str_new`.  One walk of an `n`-name module dict
# therefore performed `n * n` wraps, and `w_str_new` allocates through
# `malloc_raw` — immortal, so nothing reclaims them.
#
# Measured before the override: 350 names walked ten times grew peak RSS by
# 156.8 MB; CPython grows none.  Removing it also took 10.3 MB off interpreter
# startup (63.9 -> 53.6 MB peak RSS, 48.0 -> 37.7 MB physical footprint), which
# is `dir(module)` inside `importlib._bootstrap` paying the same quadratic.  The
# threshold below is deliberately far above the fixed interpreter floor and far
# below the quadratic figure, so it fails on the defect without tracking
# allocator noise.
#
# The equality half is the correctness guard for the O(1) cursor itself: a
# `nth_item` that indexes the storage directly must agree, entry for entry and in
# order, with the materialised `items()` it replaced, and a `values()` view --
# which skips the name wrap entirely -- must agree with the same walk's values.
