# Guard-failure blackhole resume across a LOAD_ATTR (issue #143 guard-12

# each failure resumes the rest of the iteration through `c.v` — a jitcode
# position the canonical splice lowers to the `load_attr_fn` residual call.
# An `abort_permanent` there crashes the blackhole with an out-of-bounds
# register read.
