# No `max-pypy-ratio`: the loop this fixture DOES compile -- its jitstats
# record `loops_compiled=2` on every backend -- runs too few iterations for
# the generated code to dominate a whole-process measurement. The run
# finishes in a fraction of a second, so a pypy ratio compares two
# interpreters' startup and reads whatever the host's process spawn cost
# happens to be that run. The jitstats baselines gate it.
# Frame-identity oracles on two compiled loops: `part_a`'s `_gf()` must name
# `leaf`, and `part_b`'s `_gf(1)` must name `main`.  `_gf(1).f_lasti` now
# folds on the portal red box instead of forcing a multi-frame adopt; the
# names still have to come from the red box at each depth, not from a
# collapsed portal slot.
