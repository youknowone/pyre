# STORE_SLICE in a hot loop: `buf[a:b] = [i, i + 1]` with *variable* bounds
# (a, b are locals, not literals) compiles to the STORE_SLICE opcode every
# iteration — literal bounds would fold to a const slice + STORE_SUBSCR.  The
# compiled per-CodeObject jitcode walks the store_slice residual (a `slice`
# object through setitem on the peeked list) instead of an abort_permanent
# marker, so the hot body JIT-compiles rather than declining to the trait leg.
# Output is verified against CPython/PyPy.
