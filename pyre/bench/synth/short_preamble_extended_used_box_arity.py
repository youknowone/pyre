# pyre-check: requires-modules=math
# A core cranelift build has no `pyre-module`, so it has no `math`.
# Skip that build by the missing module. A build that links `math` still runs.
# pyre-check: jitstats-band=guard_failures=16
# guard_failures measured 347 on macOS arm64, 345 on ubuntu and 335 on
# windows (CI run 36401570302) for the same source.
# The loop over `cdf(invcdf(p))` reads each lambda's closure cell, a heap
# short box whose receiver is another short box.  The loop's own close adds
# that box to the LABEL through `ExtendedShortPreambleBuilder`; a bridge back
# onto the loop must carry it too, or its JUMP is one arg short of the LABEL.
