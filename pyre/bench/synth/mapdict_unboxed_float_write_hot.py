# Hot STORE to an unboxed FLOAT attribute, the counterpart of
# `mapdict_unboxed_float_read_hot`. A same-type float update writes the value's
# IEEE-754 bit pattern straight into the existing longlong-list slot, and the
# loop now records that as the `setarrayitem_gc` it is, so it leaves NO
# residual.
#
# It used to leave `jit_mapdict_unboxed_write_f`, recorded as
# `[Ref, Int, Int, Float] -> Void`, and that is why this file exists. The shape
# is `(i64, i64, i64, f64) -> ()` on wasm: void, so the typed result family
# cannot express it, and float-carrying, so the uniform word family
# `residual_call_void_true_arity` covers cannot either -- before the backend
# grew a void arm over descr-derived parameter types, every iteration went out
# through the `jit_call` host trampoline: 3998959 crossings for 4000000
# iterations against the int store's 1, and 0.69s of execution against the int
# store's 0.02s. dynasm read 0.02s for both at the same point, so the whole gap
# was the crossing. The int-valued store below was the control that kept the
# attribution honest: same loop, same class shape, a
# `[Ref, Int, Int, Int] -> Void` descr the uniform word family already lowered
# in-module.
#
# Neither loop reaches a residual any more, so NEITHER gates that void arm.
# What this file still measures is the store itself against pypy.
#
# No `max-wasm-ratio` header -- that directive is an ALLOWANCE carved out of
# `WASM_MAX_DYNASM_RATIO`, and this fixture wants the default. Sized so
# dynasm's execution-only time clears FLOOR_GATE_MIN_BASELINE_S; below that the
# gate declines to judge.
#
# The trailing legs pin the shapes the unboxed store must refuse:
#
#   * storing an int into a float slot is a TYPE CHANGE, which revokes
#     unboxing rather than reinterpreting the word;
#   * storing a float into an int slot is the same event in reverse;
#   * NaN and the infinities round-trip as bit patterns, so they must come back
#     as themselves and not as a boxed re-read.
