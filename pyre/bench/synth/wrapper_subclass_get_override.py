# `typeobject.py descr_getattribute` resolves an attribute through
# `type(descr).__get__`, so a `classmethod` / `staticmethod` SUBCLASS that
# overrides `__get__` binds through that override.  A fold that unwraps
# `w_function` in its place calls the wrapped callable directly and never
# reaches the override, which is why every wrapper type test is exact.
#
# One loop per fold that unwraps a wrapper — class receiver, instance
# receiver, and the `__getattr__` hook's two arms — each reading through a
# direct call so the fold is the shape that records, not a lambda's
# megamorphic call site.  Every loop must report the OVERRIDE.
# Sized for the fold, not for throughput: the declining path runs the whole
# descriptor protocol per iteration, so this costs far more per `N` than a
# folded loop.  Every loop still compiles at N=2000, leaving a wide margin.
N = 100000
