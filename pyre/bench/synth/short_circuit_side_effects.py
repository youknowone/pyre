# Short-circuit and/or chains whose operands call side-effecting helpers,
# inside a hot loop whose first operand flips truthiness after warm-up. The
# helpers bump global counters; the computed totals were always correct, but
# the counters over-counted under the JIT because an aborted trace (or a
# guard-failure replay) re-executed iterations whose side effects had already
# committed once. Output is byte-exact vs the interpreter only if every
# helper call runs exactly once per iteration across warm-up, tracing,
# aborts, bridges, and deopts.
