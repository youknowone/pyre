description: Reproduce Linux-only pyre failures on macOS inside Apple's `container` CLI, using the Ubuntu 24.04 repro image in `tools/`. Invoked via `/apple-container`. Use this skill whenever a failure is visible on a Linux CI leg but not locally — a `CPython suite (gate)` row, an ubuntu-only `pyre/check.py` failure, a crash that only the linux runner sees — or when the user says "linux에서 재현해줘", "run this in the container", "ubuntu에서 확인", "apple container로 돌려줘". Also use it before claiming a Linux-only red is inherited or unreproducible.

# Reproduce Linux-only failures with Apple `container`

Only the CI legs on `ubuntu-24.04` run some checks, and darwin/linux divergence
is a recurring source of reds that cannot be judged from a macOS worktree. This
skill runs the same code under a Linux userspace on the same machine.

**Use Apple's `container` CLI and nothing else. Never Docker, never Podman,
never `colima`.** If `container` is missing, stop and say so — do not substitute
another runtime.

## What this can and cannot reproduce

Verified 2026-08-13 against the image on this machine. Read this table before
promising a repro:

| target | works? | why |
|---|---|---|
| A crash / wrong answer from a bench or script | **yes** | run the binary directly |
| `pyre/cpython_tests/run.py` — the `CPython suite (gate)` job | **yes** | the runner needs no oracle |
| `pyre/check.py` ratio + jitstats gates | **no** | needs CPython **3.14** and `pypy3`; the image has python 3.12 and no pypy |
| `pyre/extra_tests/parity_tests/run.py` | **no** | also needs CPython 3.14 as its oracle |

The parity gap will matter more than it does today: the runner supports a
`# pyre-check: platforms=linux` header that *skips* a fixture on macOS, so the
container would be the only place on this machine that runs it — and it is
exactly where the oracle is missing. No fixture uses that header yet. Until one
does, or until the image carries CPython 3.14, run the script directly against
the Linux binary and diff its output against the macOS CPython by hand.

`pyre/check.py` refuses up front with *"no CPython 3.14 to measure against …
python3: 3.12. Name one with PYRE_CHECK_PYTHON3."* Do not work around it by
pointing `PYRE_CHECK_PYTHON3` at 3.12 — the message explains why an older
CPython disagrees on version-sensitive behaviour and timings. Closing that gap
means adding CPython 3.14 and pypy3 to the image, which is a deliberate change
to `tools/`, not something to improvise per run.

## Images

`tools/ubuntu24-amd64-repro/` holds the Dockerfile. Two variants matter:

- **arm64** (`pyre-ubuntu24-arm64-repro`) — native on Apple silicon, so builds
  and runs at full speed. Use it to answer *"is this linux-vs-macos?"*. Its
  charon lives at `$PYRE_SHARED_BUILD/charon/linux-aarch64`.
- **amd64** (`pyre-ubuntu24-amd64-repro`) — matches the GitHub `ubuntu-24.04`
  runner's architecture, and runs under `--rosetta`, so it is much slower. Use
  it only when the arm64 answer disagrees with CI, or when the failure is
  plausibly x86-specific (codegen, alignment, float formatting).

Build (per `tools/ubuntu24-amd64-repro/README.md`):

```shell
container build --platform linux/amd64 -m 8G -c 4 --progress plain \
  -t pyre-ubuntu24-amd64-repro tools/ubuntu24-amd64-repro
```

## Workflow

1. Check whether the container is already up — do not start a second one:

   ```shell
   container list -a 2>/dev/null | rg pyre-linux
   ```

   A `stopped` row is not a missing container — `container start pyre-linux`
   and keep the toolchain it already has.

2. Start it if absent, from the repository root. **Three** mounts are required:
   the worktree; the shared build cache **outside** the worktree so sibling
   worktrees and container runs reuse one charon install; and the main checkout
   at its own host path, because these worktrees are `git worktree`s (see the
   trap below).

   ```shell
   mkdir -p "$(dirname "$PWD")/.pyre-build"
   MAIN=$(sed -n 's|^gitdir: \(.*\)/\.git/worktrees/.*|\1|p' .git)   # empty in a normal clone
   container run -d --name pyre-linux --platform linux/arm64 -m 12G -c 4 \
     --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/workspace/pyre \
     --mount type=bind,source="$(dirname "$PWD")/.pyre-build",target=/workspace/.pyre-build \
     --mount type=bind,source="$MAIN",target="$MAIN" \
     pyre-ubuntu24-arm64-repro sleep infinity
   ```

   `-m` is the memory cap — the container is where the "always cap memory when
   running pyre" rule is enforced, so never drop it.

   Then mark both trees safe, or every `git` call inside refuses on ownership:

   ```shell
   container exec pyre-linux sh -c "git config --global --add safe.directory /workspace/pyre
                                    git config --global --add safe.directory $MAIN"
   ```

3. One-time per cache, inside the container:

   ```shell
   container exec pyre-linux sh -c 'cd /workspace/pyre && python3 scripts/install-charon.py'
   container exec pyre-linux sh -c 'cd /workspace/pyre && charon toolchain-path'
   ```

   The first downloads a prebuilt charon into the shared cache, so it is nearly
   free after the first worktree does it. The second triggers the pinned
   nightly's install, and that lands in the container's **own** filesystem —
   `rustc-dev` alone is several hundred MB and takes many minutes. It survives
   `container stop`/`start` but **not** `container rm`, so do not delete the
   container to "reset" something; stop it instead.

4. **Set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to an absolute path for every build and run.** The
   worktree is bind-mounted, so an unqualified Linux `cargo build` writes into
   the same `target/release/` the macOS binaries live in and silently replaces
   them. It must be **absolute**: `scripts/extract-llbc.py` runs charon once per
   crate with that crate's directory as the cwd, so a relative value scatters a
   separate `target-linux/` into every crate — 4.8 GB across four crates,
   untracked and outside `.gitignore`'s anchored `/target-linux` rule.

   ```shell
   container exec pyre-linux sh -c 'cd /workspace/pyre \
     && export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/workspace/pyre/target-linux CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 \
     && python3 scripts/extract-llbc.py \
     && cargo build --release -p pyrex --bin pyre-cranelift \
          --no-default-features --features cranelift'
   ```

   `scripts/extract-llbc.py` takes **no crate arguments** — the bare form
   extracts the whole set. Naming a subset mixes fresh and stale artefacts.
   Budget for it: on this machine the extract alone ran ~35 min (four dev-profile
   charon passes) and the release build another ~20.

5. Run the thing that is red on Linux:

   ```shell
   # a bench or script
   container exec pyre-linux sh -c 'cd /workspace/pyre \
     && RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target-linux/release/pyre-cranelift pyre/bench/synth/<name>.py'

   # the CPython suite gate job
   container exec pyre-linux sh -c 'cd /workspace/pyre \
     && python3 pyre/cpython_tests/run.py --backend cranelift \
          --binary target-linux/release/pyre-cranelift --filter <module>'
   ```

6. Report by comparing the two hosts explicitly: what macOS does, what Linux
   does, and whether that matches the CI leg. A repro that only reproduces on
   one architecture is itself the finding — say which.

7. Leave the container running. Remove it only when asked:

   ```shell
   container rm -f pyre-linux
   ```

## Traps

- **A `git worktree` breaks every git call inside the container**, and
  `scripts/extract-llbc.py` runs `git ls-files` for its fingerprint, so the
  extract dies before it starts:

  ```
  fatal: not a git repository: /Users/youknowone/Projects/pyre/.git/worktrees/pyre-6
  ```

  A worktree's `.git` is a *file* holding `gitdir: <absolute host path>` into the
  main checkout's `.git/worktrees/`. Mounting only the worktree leaves that path
  unresolvable. The mount in step 2 maps the main checkout to the **identical**
  path inside the container, which is what makes the pointer resolve — a
  different target does not work, the path is baked into the `.git` file. This
  is not a `safe.directory` problem; that error is a different one and needs the
  `git config` calls above as well.
- **A Linux red is not automatically the branch's.** Check main's own CI at
  your merge-base first, and diff your branch's row list against main's before
  attributing anything. The suite gate rides `cargo-test-linux` on
  `ubuntu-24.04`, which is also where the baseline's verdicts are enforced, so
  a row the container disagrees about is a finding rather than a known skew.
- **`target-linux/` must not be committed.** Confirm it is ignored before
  building, or the worktree fills with Linux objects.
- **Timing measured in the container is not a measurement.** It is a VM sharing
  the host's cores with whatever else is running. Use the container for
  crashes, assertions, and wrong answers — never to judge a perf ratio.
- **The container sees your uncommitted edits**, because the worktree is
  bind-mounted. That is the point, but it also means a rebase or a sibling
  session's edit changes what the container is building mid-run. It cuts the
  other way too: `source=` is a hash of the tree, so editing anything after an
  extraction marks the artefacts stale — do the extract last and leave the tree
  alone until whatever you are measuring has finished.
- **The container's extraction overwrites the host's `build/llbc`.** The
  driver's `out_dir` is a fixed `<repo-root>/build/llbc` with no override, and
  the worktree is bind-mounted, so `extract-llbc.py` inside the container
  replaces the artefacts your macOS build reads. Budget a full host re-extract
  (~25 min) before building on the host again. Every field the freshness check
  compares is computed from the tracked tree and so agrees across hosts;
  `platform=` is the one that does not, and `fail_if_llbc_stale` now refuses on
  it rather than letting the build fail somewhere downstream.
