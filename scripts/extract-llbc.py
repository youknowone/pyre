"""Forwarding shim: extraction drivers now live per-repo.

The pyre crate table moved to `pyre/scripts/extract-llbc.py` (external consumer
repos carry their own drivers). This shim preserves the historical
`scripts/extract-llbc.py` entry point that CI, `build.rs`, and `check.py`
invoke, forwarding argv verbatim.

# `subprocess.run`, not `os.execv`: on Windows `os.execv` does not replace the
# process image — it spawns the child and the parent returns immediately with
# exit 0, so the invoking shell step finishes before the extraction driver has
# produced any `build/llbc/*.ullbc`, and the following upload-artifact step
# fails with `if-no-files-found: error`. Run the driver as a child and forward
# its exit code so every platform blocks until extraction completes.
