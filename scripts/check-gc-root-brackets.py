"""Hold the hand-written GC root brackets to what the analysis can prove.

`rpython/memory/gctransform/` inserts the shadow-stack bracket automatically:
`framework.py` brackets every operation that can reach the collector,
`shadowstack.py` emits the `gc_push_roots` / `gc_pop_roots` pair, and
`expand_pop_roots` turns the pop into one `gc_restore_root` per variable.
The graph-wide framework marker insertion and `shadowcolor` stages are now
automatic. Native interpreter paths are also compiled directly by rustc, so
they retain their existing source `push_roots` brackets and this gate stops
those brackets being taken on trust. See the module docs on
`majit-translate/src/memory/gctransform/mod.rs` for that current port boundary.

Some of the reported numbers are invariants at zero and are held there.  The
rest are a backlog: they are ratcheted, so a change may pay them down but not
add to them.

The baseline holds one entry per platform.  The scan reads an artefact built
from this platform's sources, and the interpreter's `cfg` arms differ across
them, so the counts do too -- a baseline written from one platform cannot be
satisfied from another, and `--update` rewrites only the entry it measured.

The ratchet counts every unbracketed call in the artefact, this branch's and
main's together.  A base that has moved brings code the baseline never saw
into the same number a regression would land in.  The gate holds that number:
a rise fails wherever it is measured, and a rise on main is fixed on main.
The run still says when the base has moved, so the reader can see whose code
the count now includes.  A column the baseline entry does not record yet is
printed as unrecorded and is not a failure; `--update` records it.

Run the analysis and compare:

    cargo build -p majit-translate --release --example gc-root-reachability
    python3 scripts/check-gc-root-brackets.py

`--update` rewrites the baseline from the current run, for a change that pays
the backlog down.
